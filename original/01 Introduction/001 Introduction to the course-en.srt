Hello and welcome to mastering data visualization and D3.js.

1
00:09.620 --> 00:10.390
. 

2
00:10.640 --> 00:15.100
My name is Adam and I'll be the one to take you through the journey of learning D   3.

3
00:15.590 --> 00:21.400
I work as a freelance data visualization engineer using my knowledge of D 3 to build complex Front-End

4
00:21.430 --> 00:23.150
systems for businesses.

5
00:23.660 --> 00:28.790
I've been living and working remotely for over a year now, picking up interesting projects from companies 

6
00:28.790 --> 00:30.670
all around the world.

7
00:30.860 --> 00:36.800
I designed and built data dashboards for successful startups including consulting roles teaching CEOs

8
00:36.800 --> 00:39.530
about the best way to design their products.

9
00:39.650 --> 00:45.280
I worked at a large NGO to communicate the results of a 20,000 person study of youths around the world

10
00:46.060 --> 00:47.420
and I've been a coach and mentor

11
00:47.440 --> 00:51.300
to new
learners of D3 who are just starting off on the same path.

12
00:52.040 --> 00:57.580
I first picked up my skills in data visualization at Harvard University where I was a computer science student

13
00:58.010 --> 01:01.250
I first learned the material that I'll be teaching in this course. 

14
01:01.550 --> 01:06.780
Although the bulk of what you'll learn will revolve around the finer points that D-3 library, the course

15
01:06.780 --> 01:11.980
is also structured to give you a formal introduction to the principles of design.

16
01:12.080 --> 01:17.180
I'll teach you how to effectively showcase your ideas justifying design decisions to your colleagues

17
01:17.650 --> 01:23.000
and also teach you how to discern between good and bad visualizations and how to avoid the most common

18
01:23.000 --> 01:24.620
pitfalls of design.

19
01:25.250 --> 01:30.260
We'll be working through four exciting projects which are all relevant to the real world and you'll

20
01:30.260 --> 01:32.510
be following along every step of the way.

21
01:32.660 --> 01:37.700
As we gradually add complexity onto what we can do with D3. By the end of this course you'll

22
01:37.700 --> 01:43.150
be able to create new and exciting visualizations of the web's premier visualization library.

23
01:43.220 --> 01:47.600
You'll learn to design and build your own projects to work with the data that matters to you the most

24
01:48.200 --> 01:51.190
and we'll be covering advanced topics in D-3 like brushes,  

25
01:51.200 --> 01:57.320
choropleths and layouts. We'll also be using the latest version of D-3: version 5.

26
01:57.650 --> 02:02.150
If you don't have much prior experience in web development then I suggest that you take a primer course

27
02:02.150 --> 02:08.420
in both JavaScript and jQuery before launching into this course. You'll want to feel comfortable with selecting

28
02:08.420 --> 02:13.670
elements on screen and interacting with the document object model in order to get the most out of

29
02:13.670 --> 02:15.680
this experience.

30
02:15.680 --> 02:21.070
This course is meant for you if you want to build user interfaces that can add real value right away.

31
02:21.350 --> 02:26.030
If you want to stand there from the crowd and generate new and interesting ideas and if you want to

32
02:26.030 --> 02:28.760
change the way that you see data in the world around you.
