In this lecture, I'm going to be giving a quick introduction to data visualization.

1
00:11.420 --> 00:16.320
I'll be showing you how we can split up visualizations into three distinct types, and I'll be showing

2
00:16.320 --> 00:19.710
you a few examples of each.

3
00:19.730 --> 00:22.710
So what exactly is a visualization?

4
00:22.760 --> 00:28.640
A quick search on Google gives us these two definitions. For this class, we'll be interested in the first definition,

5
00:28.880 --> 00:33.660
which involves representing some kind of abstract information in a visual form.

6
00:34.100 --> 00:38.990
If you're looking for a class on visualization that covers the second definition here, then this might

7
00:38.990 --> 00:40.470
not be the right course for you.

8
00:42.200 --> 00:48.710
Data visualization is a pretty broad discipline which can cover all sorts of different things. For the

9
00:48.710 --> 00:50.180
purposes of this course,

10
00:50.270 --> 00:56.690
we can split up the most common uses of visualization between exploring data - helping us discover something

11
00:56.690 --> 01:04.820
new; analyzing data - testing a theory about the state of the world; or presenting data - which involves communicating

12
01:04.820 --> 01:14.020
something to others. For exploring data, visualizations can be used to find some kind of unknown. A classic

13
01:14.020 --> 01:19.750
example here is the work of Edward Muybridge, who was tasked with settling a bet by finding out whether

14
01:19.750 --> 01:23.430
galloping horses ever have all four hooves off the ground

15
01:23.440 --> 01:27.380
at once. This isn't something that we can tell by the naked eye,

16
01:27.710 --> 01:32.070
so Muybridge used a series of experiments with photographs to find this

17
01:32.120 --> 01:33.430
out for sure.

18
01:33.530 --> 01:39.290
The result from these pictures proved the matter once and for all, as you can see here in the top few frames that

19
01:39.290 --> 01:42.670
the horse is completely in mid-air for a good part of its stride.

20
01:44.180 --> 01:50.210
For a more practical example, for your final project in this course, you'll be building a data dashboard that

21
01:50.210 --> 01:54.520
lets a manager compare the sales performance of different teams in his workforce.

22
01:55.600 --> 02:01.930
Here, the goal is to provide a visual tool to determine how these groups compare side by side, exploring

23
02:01.930 --> 02:05.770
the raw numbers to see how this has changed over time.

24
02:05.830 --> 02:11.540
The manager can then determine which groups are causing the most problems in his business and act accordingly.

25
02:12.610 --> 02:17.800
For analyzing data, visualizations are made to test the hypothesis that we have about the state of the

26
02:17.800 --> 02:18.620
world.

27
02:18.990 --> 02:23.320
A classic example here is from the 19th century Docor John Snow.

28
02:23.320 --> 02:25.030
Not this one.

29
02:25.300 --> 02:30.640
He used a heat map of cholera cases in an area of London to prove his hypothesis that these deaths

30
02:30.640 --> 02:34.540
were spread by water pumps in the area, rather than by decaying organic matter,

31
02:34.590 --> 02:40.350
as other people had thought. For visualizations focused on presenting data,

32
02:40.380 --> 02:45.920
the goal is to communicate some kind of story, and hopefully to inspire people to take action.

33
02:45.940 --> 02:51.520
The most common examples here are from the New York Times, who often run interactive data visualizations

34
02:51.520 --> 02:53.210
on their website.

35
02:53.230 --> 02:58.750
These visualizations appear within a block of text that communicates a certain story, and the visualizations

36
02:58.750 --> 03:00.020
are built to support it.

37
03:01.630 --> 03:06.670
Now that you've learned a little bit about what visualizations look like, I want you to look for the

38
03:06.670 --> 03:10.200
best visualization that you can find online.

39
03:10.300 --> 03:17.110
Some great places to start are on Reddit at the subreddit "data is beautiful", flowingdata.com, which

40
03:17.110 --> 03:22.900
has a lot of visualizations built with D3, or you can just start looking for visualizations on

41
03:22.960 --> 03:29.380
Google. A great thing about Udemy is that you can take this class alongside many other students who

42
03:29.380 --> 03:32.060
are going through the same learning process as you.

43
03:32.470 --> 03:37.810
I want you to share your favorite visualizations in the comments to the next activity, so that we can

44
03:37.810 --> 03:40.930
crowd-fund some of the best visualizations out there.

45
03:41.860 --> 03:47.320
See what your other classmates have come up with and really get a feel for how varied displays of data

46
03:47.320 --> 03:47.960
can be.
