In this lecture I'll be introducing you to what you can do with D3 - the world's premiere data

1
00:11.570 --> 00:13.710
visualization library.

2
00:13.830 --> 00:18.600
I'll be talking about why I believe the D3 is the best library to learn if you want to know how to

3
00:18.600 --> 00:24.210
visualize data on the web, and I'll be showing you some cool examples of the kinds of visualizations

4
00:24.210 --> 00:30.150
that you can make with D3. Although D3 has quickly grown to be the Web's favorite choice for displaying

5
00:30.150 --> 00:31.520
data online,

6
00:31.530 --> 00:38.120
there are a number of alternatives out there for developers to use. Fusion Charts, High Charts, Chartjs,

7
00:38.130 --> 00:44.800
and even Google Charts can all be seen as competitors to D3.

8
00:44.830 --> 00:50.700
So why am I teaching this course in D3, rather than any other data visualization tool out there?

9
00:51.490 --> 00:57.360
For me there are three main reasons why D3 blows any of these alternatives out of the water.

10
00:57.640 --> 01:06.360
D3's flexibility, the elegance of how it's written, and the active community that supports it.

11
01:06.360 --> 01:13.440
The first reason is flexibility. D3 lets you load in your own data and do whatever you want with it.

12
01:13.440 --> 01:18.610
It doesn't just come with a set of predefined templates for making different common graphs like many

13
01:18.610 --> 01:25.260
other libraries. D3 gives you the tools to make these charts yourself, and you can do so much more on

14
01:25.260 --> 01:26.080
top of it.

15
01:27.040 --> 01:30.080
D3 stands for Data Driven Documents.

16
01:30.160 --> 01:33.930
It's all about connecting elements on the page to pieces of data.

17
01:34.060 --> 01:39.970
This data can be absolutely anything, and it allows for lots of interesting use cases, especially for

18
01:39.970 --> 01:42.300
interactive visualizations.

19
01:42.500 --> 01:47.260
If you can imagine something as a way of displaying data, then you can build it in D3.

20
01:47.270 --> 01:48.200
Simple as that.

21
01:50.650 --> 01:53.420
Check out this chart I made earlier this year.

22
01:53.800 --> 01:59.610
It's displaying how the income distribution has been changing in the US over the last 50 years.

23
01:59.650 --> 02:04.570
There isn't a template that you could use to make this in any other system, because there's no name for

24
02:04.570 --> 02:06.670
this type of visualization.

25
02:06.700 --> 02:12.280
It's a pie chart but part of the storytelling message comes from how it changes over time.

26
02:12.280 --> 02:17.980
This was something that I made just by thinking about how this data could be displayed in D3.

27
02:17.980 --> 02:23.110
Once I had that, and once I sketched out how it should look, then it was easy to move things around and

28
02:23.110 --> 02:24.050
make it work.

29
02:25.880 --> 02:31.480
A good analogy to consider here is the idea of building a model house with either clay or Lego.

30
02:31.910 --> 02:36.830
It might seem easier to build the house out of Lego, because all of the building blocks click together

31
02:36.860 --> 02:43.590
really easily. However, if you want to make something more custom, or if you don't like the design of the

32
02:43.590 --> 02:49.250
few different pieces that you have to choose from, then it would be better to make it out of clay.

33
02:49.290 --> 02:54.930
This is the kind of option that D3 gives us.

34
02:54.980 --> 03:00.710
The second reason for using D3 is that you can create beautiful visualizations in a quick and easy

35
03:00.710 --> 03:01.980
way.

36
03:02.030 --> 03:08.690
The D3 source code is written impeccably, and it's easy to visualize a huge volume of data with little to

37
03:08.690 --> 03:10.830
no lag between updates.

38
03:11.210 --> 03:16.970
D3 also comes built with a sophisticated transition suite, which seamlessly allows us to switch up the

39
03:16.970 --> 03:19.210
position of shapes on the screen.

40
03:19.670 --> 03:25.970
Once we get the hang of how a D-3 script should work, it's also really easy to figure out exactly what

41
03:25.970 --> 03:31.340
each line is doing, as community code usually follows the same naming conventions.

42
03:32.890 --> 03:35.340
I'll show you a simple example that I found online

43
03:35.350 --> 03:40.180
which uses D3, and show you what it's doing behind the scenes with the console inspector here.

44
03:41.280 --> 03:47.490
Look at how each of these elements are changing so smoothly as the browser runs. D3 is rapidly

45
03:47.490 --> 03:53.220
changing the attributes of the different pie slices so that every time the graph updates, the updates

46
03:53.220 --> 03:59.980
are incredibly smooth. We can add transitions like this with just a couple of lines of code in D3, and

47
04:00.000 --> 04:04.120
D3 handles the heavy lifting of bringing about the different updates.

48
04:07.100 --> 04:13.400
My last reason for using D3 is the community behind it. With D3 growing more and more popular every

49
04:13.400 --> 04:14.100
year,

50
04:14.300 --> 04:20.210
there is a vast ecosystem which you can use to find pre-built code to use in your own projects.

51
04:20.210 --> 04:25.790
D3 is completely open source, and you can use any of this community code without needing to worry about

52
04:25.820 --> 04:27.710
any licensing.

53
04:27.710 --> 04:32.400
This course will be tailored to helping you to access this community as easily as possible.

54
04:33.500 --> 04:38.070
I'll be taking you through real examples of how I would pull other people's code from the community,

55
04:38.490 --> 04:44.800
and I'll be helping you to understand it. As D3 also boasts a wide user base, which is growing every

56
04:44.800 --> 04:51.100
day, it's becoming a hot skill to know in web development roles, especially since understanding and presenting

57
04:51.100 --> 04:58.410
data is such a vital component of so many business strategies.

58
04:58.410 --> 05:03.870
At this point, I hope that you're excited to get stuck in with programming in D3. In the next lecture,

59
05:03.870 --> 05:07.680
I'll be walking through a broad overview of how this course is structured,

60
05:07.680 --> 05:11.390
before diving into the building blocks of D-3 in the next section.
