In this lecture, I'll be giving you a general overview of how this course will look.

1
00:10.870 --> 00:15.970
I'll be talking about how the course is split into three different parts, and I'll introduce you to the

2
00:15.970 --> 00:19.350
four class projects that you complete at different stages.

3
00:21.450 --> 00:26.550
In each of the first few sections of the course, I'll be teaching new concepts that should add onto the

4
00:26.550 --> 00:33.450
previous sections to give you a strong foundation in D3. You'll learn how to render SVGs to the screen

5
00:33.450 --> 00:35.050
to express data.

6
00:35.130 --> 00:40.250
You learn how to use scales and axes for some common visualizations like bar charts and scatterplots.

7
00:41.160 --> 00:47.460
You'll be making visualizations that dynamically update to changing data, and you'll be making interactive

8
00:47.460 --> 00:50.740
visualizations that react to user input.

9
00:50.760 --> 00:56.280
Importantly, I'll be helping you to thoroughly understand the D3 update pattern, teaching you what's

10
00:56.280 --> 01:01.010
going on behind the scenes, which will allow you to make any visualization that you can imagine.

11
01:02.790 --> 01:09.240
In sections 7, 8, and 9, I'll be giving you a crash course in a range of different visualizations, showing

12
01:09.240 --> 01:13.650
you how the principles that we learned in the first phase of the course can help us to quickly pick

13
01:13.650 --> 01:18.290
up any type of visualization. I'll be stepping you through sunburst plots,

14
01:18.310 --> 01:20.640
node-link diagrams, choropleth maps,

15
01:20.640 --> 01:21.340
treemaps,

16
01:21.340 --> 01:28.300
trees, area charts, and more, and I'll be teaching you the process of finding, interpreting, and adapting

17
01:28.750 --> 01:32.240
any kind of visualization by yourself.

18
01:32.320 --> 01:39.130
Finally, in Section 10, you'll be writing complex linked views, where visualizations on the page communicate

19
01:39.130 --> 01:41.860
to each other through a controller file.

20
01:41.860 --> 01:47.050
At this point, your page will be handling updates for several different charts at once, which will be

21
01:47.050 --> 01:53.230
rendering as javascript objects, which will also make code more reusable for future projects.

22
01:54.280 --> 01:59.230
You'll complete four different class projects in this course, which will gradually become more complex as

23
01:59.230 --> 02:03.520
your skill level increases. For your first project,

24
02:03.520 --> 02:06.920
you'll be making a simple bar chart for a friend's business.

25
02:06.970 --> 02:12.160
You can see that at this point, the visualization will be fairly simple and won't really exceed anything

26
02:12.160 --> 02:17.400
that you could whip up in Microsoft Excel. For your second project,

27
02:17.440 --> 02:23.500
You'll be making an updating scatterplot, based on a famous visualization from Gapminder, showing how

28
02:23.500 --> 02:27.110
countries' incomes have increased with life expectancy over time.

29
02:28.120 --> 02:33.730
Here, we already have a complex visualization, with data coming from positional attributes as well as

30
02:33.730 --> 02:39.240
from the size and color of the circles. In your third project,

31
02:39.240 --> 02:45.030
you'll be creating a line chart that tracks cryptocurrency data over time, which can show different coins

32
02:45.090 --> 02:51.690
with different metrics like price and trading volume, and can be filtered based on a date range.

33
02:51.690 --> 02:57.460
At this point, you'll be able to manage a complex system that is updating automatically, and you'll develop

34
02:57.460 --> 03:05.110
a production quality interface, working with real data. Finally, for your last project,

35
03:05.130 --> 03:11.010
you'll be building a data dashboard to keep tabs on different sales teams' performance at a large conglomerate

36
03:11.010 --> 03:17.840
company. Here, your data will be split across different files and you'll simultaneously be rendering

37
03:17.840 --> 03:20.280
six separate visualizations to the screen.
