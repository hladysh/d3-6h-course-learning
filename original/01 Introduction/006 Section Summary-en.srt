By now, I hope that you're ready for the challenge of learning D3,

1
00:09.550 --> 00:14.640
and excited by the possibilities that this powerful JavaScript library has to offer.

2
00:14.730 --> 00:19.230
You should now know a basic amount about visualizations, and you should understand why D3 is such a

3
00:19.230 --> 00:21.710
great entry point for web development work.

4
00:22.630 --> 00:26.920
You also know what to expect from the course as I've shown you what you'll be learning across three

5
00:26.920 --> 00:30.560
different stages, and you've had a look at the four class projects that

6
00:30.580 --> 00:33.690
you'll get to complete. In the next section,

7
00:33.700 --> 00:36.880
I'll be helping you to get set up with your development environment,

8
00:36.970 --> 00:42.700
using D3 by yourself, and I'll be introducing you to some of the most important concepts for the library.

9
00:43.030 --> 00:47.870
You'll be writing your first lines of D3 code, and attaching your first SVGs to the screen.
