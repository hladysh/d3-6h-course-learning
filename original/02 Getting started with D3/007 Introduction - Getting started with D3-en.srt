00:06.210 --> 00:10.330
In this section, I'll be helping you to get set up with everything that you'll need for the course, and

1
00:10.330 --> 00:13.350
you'll get your first real taste of programming in D3.

2
00:14.510 --> 00:19.780
I'll start off by helping you set up your development environment, showing you all of the basic software

3
00:19.790 --> 00:22.880
that I currently use for D3 development.

4
00:23.680 --> 00:28.620
Next, I'll introduce you to what SVGs are, and how they work with D3.

5
00:28.780 --> 00:32.820
I'll show you how to use some of the basic D3 commands to write shapes the screen,

6
00:33.130 --> 00:37.360
and I'll take you through how we can associate these shapes with pieces of data.

7
00:38.410 --> 00:43.370
By the end of this section, you'll have created something that actually looks like a real visualization.

8
00:44.530 --> 00:50.650
You'll be using rectangles to represent the heights of the world's tallest buildings, which will be a

9
00:50.650 --> 00:53.680
precursor for our first real visualization,

10
00:53.680 --> 00:56.680
when you be making a bar chart at the end of section three.
