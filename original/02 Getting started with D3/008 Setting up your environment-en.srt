In this lecture I'll be helping you to set up your development environment for programming in D-3 

1
00:11.170 --> 00:14.930
I'll show you the web browser and text editor that I'll be using in this course, 

2
00:14.980 --> 00:20.410
I'll introduce you to the template files you'll be working from and I'll help you to get set up with an HTTP server

3
00:20.710 --> 00:21.880
for your local machine.

4
00:23.770 --> 00:29.140
For a web browser, I recommend that you use Google Chrome because it has a really nice set of developer

5
00:29.140 --> 00:31.350
tools and it's fast.

6
00:31.420 --> 00:35.560
It'll make it easier for you to follow along with my examples if we're looking at files in the same

7
00:35.560 --> 00:36.430
browser.

8
00:36.630 --> 00:40.030
But you're free to use whichever browser you feel most comfortable with.

9
00:41.310 --> 00:46.410
You'll also want to get yourself a simple text editor for this course. For all the project that we'll

10
00:46.410 --> 00:46.960
cover,

11
00:47.000 --> 00:54.500
I'll be using Sublime Text 3, which is a basic text editor that works across Windows Mac OS and Linux.

12
00:54.570 --> 00:59.310
You can get a trial version of this software for free on Sublime's website or you can actually pay for

13
00:59.310 --> 01:02.530
the software to stop it bugging you with pop ups every now and then.

14
01:04.160 --> 01:06.970
It doesn't take much to get started with D-3.

15
01:07.190 --> 01:11.680
We'll be using D-3 version 5, which you can find in the D-3 GitHub page

16
01:11.690 --> 01:17.960
by following this link right here. You just need to include the D-3 library somewhere in your HTML

17
01:18.260 --> 01:24.140
in the same way that you'd include any other JavaScript library like jQuery or Underscore. You'll often

18
01:24.150 --> 01:30.150
see these script tags are used to include D-3 in an HTML file, but we'll actually be downloading the file

19
01:30.350 --> 01:37.830
into our template folders, which is a good habit to develop in case anything changes with the copy online. To keep

20
01:37.830 --> 01:41.820
things simple so that you don't need to worry about getting the right versions of the different scripts

21
01:41.820 --> 01:43.640
that we'll be using in this course,

22
01:43.640 --> 01:45.360
I'll include everything that you'll need

23
01:45.360 --> 01:51.460
in the template folder for each project. I'm keeping all my files in this directory here which is organized

24
01:51.460 --> 01:57.560
into the different sections that we'll cover. Here we can see all the files from this section which is organized

25
01:57.560 --> 01:59.280
by lecture.

26
01:59.300 --> 02:03.460
I'm going to open up this whole folder in Sublime so I can show you how everything's structured.

27
02:04.690 --> 02:08.000
Let's take a look at a file from later on in this section.

28
02:08.370 --> 02:14.970
Here we are looking at an index.html file, which we'll be running in a web browser. Here I'm including Bootstrap

29
02:14.970 --> 02:16.820
to help structure the page.

30
02:17.300 --> 02:23.970
Here is a CSS file that I'll sometimes use to add some custom styling. Here we're including the D-3 library, which I

31
02:24.050 --> 02:32.840
downloaded to the .js directory and here's the file that we'll be writing all D-3 code in. For most

32
02:32.840 --> 02:37.610
of the visualizations that we'll be creating in this course, it is important to note that they'll need to run

33
02:37.620 --> 02:44.080
over a local HTTP server because our page will be sharing files between different folders.

34
02:44.090 --> 02:49.070
There are a few different programs that you can use for this but for this cause I'll be using the HTTP

35
02:49.070 --> 02:52.620
server that comes in built with Python.

36
02:52.680 --> 02:57.070
If you have Python already installed on your machine then it's super easy to get started.

37
02:57.390 --> 03:02.940
If not, then just download Python from the official website and make sure that you can get the latest version

38
03:02.960 --> 03:04.540
for whichever operating system you use.

39
03:04.560 --> 03:09.480
Use once you have Python installed,

40
03:09.480 --> 03:15.550
fire up your terminal in the folder that you want to run your server and run the command 

41
03:15.550 --> 03:20.970
python3 -n http.server

42
03:23.660 --> 03:27.130
So here we can see that the server is working on port 8000

43
03:27.350 --> 03:32.750
So if we navigate to our browser to local host 8000, then we should be able to see the files from

44
03:32.750 --> 03:34.770
the directory that we're looking at.

45
03:35.300 --> 03:40.430
I'm running my terminal from the root directory of all my project files so I can click through to whichever

46
03:40.430 --> 03:42.150
directory that I want to look at.

47
03:43.510 --> 03:48.000
This folder here for 2.6 should be the same as the one we have in the Sublime window.

48
03:48.670 --> 03:53.350
As long as you're always looking at your page through a local host server, then your visualization should

49
03:53.350 --> 03:54.190
show up here.

50
03:55.640 --> 04:00.470
So hopefully by now you should have everything that you need to start programming in D-3.

51
04:00.600 --> 04:05.550
If you have any problems setting this stuff up then leave me a comment in this video and I'll try to help

52
04:05.550 --> 04:07.000
out what's going wrong.

53
04:07.710 --> 04:12.200
Now that we're finished with set up we're ready to start learning about SVGs and how to add them into

54
04:12.220 --> 04:12.770
the screen.
