00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,790
In this section you set up your environment for programming in D-3 you learn West veejays are and how

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,360
to add them into the screen with both HDMI out and T-3 and you poor form your first data joint associate

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
these shapes with pieces of data.

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,640
With what you just created and the last activity you have the building blocks for real visualization

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,440
you can use this image to convey something numerical into something that people can picture for themselves.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,860
There's not too much of a jump between what you just made now and in making a fully fledged bartk in

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,250
the next section I'll be teaching you how to do just that.

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,830
Introducing you to scales and axes and building up the visualization that we have now into something

9
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,760
more substantial.
