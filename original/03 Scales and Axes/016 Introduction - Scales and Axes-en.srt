00:06.590 --> 00:12.040
At the end of last section we ended up with something that actually looked like a real visualization.

1
00:12.390 --> 00:17.330
We were communicating some data using rectangles on the screen to represent the heights at different

2
00:17.330 --> 00:18.410
buildings.

3
00:19.040 --> 00:22.430
But where did the height values for those rectangles come from.

4
00:23.990 --> 00:28.870
I actually just gave you some real numbers that will be the right size to fit on your ass Ficci.

5
00:28.890 --> 00:35.400
Candace over the course of this section will gradually expand on the visualization that you ended up

6
00:35.400 --> 00:40.420
with at the end of last section to turn it into a bar chart.

7
00:40.470 --> 00:45.930
I'll be teaching at to use scales in D-3 to take in more data and spits out some values that we can

8
00:45.930 --> 00:47.440
work with.

9
00:47.520 --> 00:52.470
We'll also be adding in some axes and labels to make it look more like a typical bar chart.

10
00:52.770 --> 00:57.540
And are we making the rectangles rise up from the bottom of the canvas rather than hanging down from

11
00:57.540 --> 01:03.640
the top at the end of the section you'll be ready to take on our first project in this class.

12
01:03.680 --> 01:09.290
You'll be helping a friend who owns a burgeoning coffee chain to make a simple bar chart communicates

13
01:09.290 --> 01:11.090
his sales figures to investors.
