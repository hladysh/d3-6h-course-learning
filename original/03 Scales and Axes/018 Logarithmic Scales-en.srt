00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,010
In this lecture be teaching about log scales and why we might need to use them instead of linear scales

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,080
in some situations.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,770
I'll also run through the syntax which looks pretty familiar from the last lecture.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,970
Sometimes you might find that you're working with a variable which is increasing exponentially over

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,400
time.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,650
In this example because population is increasing so rapidly if you want to show population size much

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,960
further in time then it would seem like the population in the first half of the graph was basically

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,410
the same level.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,940
In cases like these it becomes more useful to use a logarithmic scale rather than a linear scale.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,400
For example for a second class project we want to show how different countries GDP per capita is changing

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,080
over time.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,710
As you can see a linear scale doesn't express this data very well.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,890
The domain of scale ranges from about $300 to $150000 which means that a lot of wasted space to fit

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,440
in the most extreme data points when we're looking at the countries in the year eighteen hundred.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,410
They all seem to be about the same level of wealth.

16
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,850
In reality some of the countries are an order of magnitude better off than others.

17
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,050
We can see this in the image on the right of our screen when GDP per capita is around $4000 per year.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,100
The richest countries and around $400 per year in the poorest countries are large scale is a much better

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,220
job using this space on our screen to show the difference between these countries.

20
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,010
Looking at this with our black box analogy again a large scale was pretty similar to what lineas go

21
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,390
we supply it with minimum and maximum values for its domain and range.

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,190
And we get an output when we give it an input.

23
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,870
We can also give it a base value which people tend.

24
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,870
This means that the output values of inputs are five hundred five thousand 50000 will be spaced equally

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,540
because that all factors of 10 part.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:17,460
If we wanted to use a base value of two instead then this would mean that our values for 500 1000 2000

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,840
would be equally spaced because they'd all be factors of two of us.

28
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,350
We can play around with the base value as much as we like to make up visualizations as useful as possible.

29
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,460
A log scale with the base of one actually works out to be the same as the linear scale.

30
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,170
Something to note here is that the domain for a log scale need to be strictly positive or strictly negative

31
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,870
because the log of zero is always undefined.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,690
If you try to make a log scale and D-3 that contain zero in its domain then the scale just simply won't

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,350
work.

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,810
To create a log scale we use D-3 scale log in terms of the syntax.

35
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,120
It's almost identical to a linear scale except that it uses an optional base method.

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,390
We're giving the scale a name of X this time because the scale is for x axis.

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,810
We can see the same inputs and outputs as a black box.

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:18,110
When we run these console logs and again we can use the invert method to go from a range back to a domain.

39
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,850
Now that you know how and when to use a large scale.

40
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,760
Next up will be running through time scales which are a special variation of linear scales that deal

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,500
with dates.
