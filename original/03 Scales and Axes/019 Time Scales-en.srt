In this lecture I'll be covering timescales which you'll often want to use in your visualizations a

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:19,550
time scale is actually a type of linear scale and D-3 but his domain works with javascript data objects

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,040
instead of integers.

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,070
His domain is between the first of January 2000 and the first of January 2002.

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,360
One if we put in the date around the middle of these two dates we get a value that's in the middle of

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,820
our range.

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,280
So here we can see that the time scale is mapping the first of July 2000 to a value of 200 which makes

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,220
sense because we're giving it the midpoint of our domain and we getting back the midpoint of our range.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,730
In case you haven't used javascript data objects before.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,660
We're creating new data objects here by passing in the year month and day that we want.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,010
It shouldn't surprise you.

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,250
The syntax here is identical to our linear scale.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
As the time scale is just a special version of it that deals with dates.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,720
If you want to do this with actual data rather than just creating a dummy data object you will need

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,630
to convert a string representation of a data to a javascript data object.

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,270
You will learn how to do this in section 6 when I'll be taking you through parsing and formatting into

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,620
three.

18
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,530
Hopefully you're getting the hang of scales by now and you can see how the syntax is working.

19
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,830
Next lecture will be covering ordinal scales to use for assigning color schemes to categories where

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,860
the syntax will be a little different when we're setting the domain.
