00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,400
In this lecture I'll be talking about ordinals Gayles which are frequently using whenever you want to

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,460
use color in your visualizations and also show you how to use the color schemes that T-3 provides us

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,220
with that generate quick and easy colors for us to use.

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,620
Sometimes we want to use scales to work with discrete data like a collection of categories instead of

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,410
continuous data.

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,710
For this we need to use an ordinal scale will pretty much only be using this type of scale when we want

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,730
to associate different categories with different colors.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,400
But it can be used to associate any two strings with each other for an ordinal scale the domain and

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,040
range are always arrays of values and the scale will provide a mapping between them based on that position

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,750
and the array.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,550
For example if we put Africare into this scale it spits out red because that both index zero in their

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,760
array.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,520
And if we put ajor into this array it will spit out blue because then both index for an array.

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,420
If we use the ordinal scale it's something that isn't in the domain then D-3 adds this value it's a

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,780
domain for us associating it with the next available range.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,450
So in this case putting Antarctica into a scale We'll add it to the domain and associate it with the

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,770
color gray.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,010
If the more values in the domain and in the range then the scale will start to loop back to the start

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,880
of our range was signing new mappings for example after we put Antarctica into upscale the domain and

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,760
range will each have set values.

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,820
If we try to insert Pangea as well then our scale doesn't have a free value that can use that range.

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,030
So it looks back and assigns that the value index 0 which is red.

23
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,840
If we wanted to call the scale and another value that isn't in our domain then the scale will assign

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,660
it to orange then yellow.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,180
So to save us from having to pick a new array of colors every time we want to make a color scale D-3

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,630
comes with a few useful functions to generate color schemes for us we can use any of these categorical

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,580
scales from that DS3 scale chromatic module which is included with the three.

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,830
And this will automatically generate some colors for us as you can imagine.

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,370
The syntax is a little different as we need to supply an array of strings to the daily method.

30
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,200
On the left I'm using the example from earlier and on the right amusing one of the D-3 color schemes

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,220
that range there is no method that can be used for an ordinal scale because it's possible for multiple

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:49,120
domain values to map to the same range value next lecture Perales scale will be returning to our buildings

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:56,040
visualisation to demonstrate band scales which are pretty much exclusively meant to be used for bartk.
