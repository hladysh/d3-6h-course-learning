1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,320
For most types of chod it's important to have some kind of axes that give us a reference point to interpret

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,350
data from our.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,720
The moment isn't particularly useful if our users don't already know what these bars are meant to represent.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,780
We can't tell which building is which.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,420
And our chart only expresses relative heights between the buildings.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,630
In this lecture we'll be adding an X in the y axis to our chart and we'll be adding in some labels indiscreet

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:45,070
version before we can use one of four different axes generators to create axes for this example we'll

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:53,140
be using D-3 access left and D-3 X's bottom but we could also have used D-3 access right and D-3 access

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,050
top.

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,080
It's important to know that each of these scale the rended the origin point device weekenders when we

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,630
first add them to the screen that's fine if the axis is on the left or at the top.

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:11,420
But if we want the axes on the bottom or on the right of our graph we want to attach our access to a

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,620
group and give it a translation for the button.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,330
This will once you give it a translation of the height of visualization and the y direction for an axis

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,340
on the rides.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,850
We need to shift it by the width about visualization in the x direction.

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,670
Let's take a look at the syntax here.

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:37,430
Follow the X generators working we're making a call to one of these Xs generators passing in the relevant

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,140
scales.

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,090
Our only argument then we're attaching SPG group to our visualization giving it a translation if necessary.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,630
And then we use the call method to run the Xs generator.

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,370
D-3 also gives us some methods that we can use on axes generators to customize how the text should look.

23
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,920
We can change the length of our text using these three methods here.

24
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,680
To take salaries out of method will only affect the outermost takes the take sides in a method will

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,470
any effect.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,500
It takes and the regular tick size method will affect them all equally.

27
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,650
If you use the tick size method alongside one of the other two methods and the last one that gets called

28
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,930
will be the one that counts.

29
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,340
We can also define how many takes should be shown on the axes by using the ticks method.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,610
Here we giving an argument of 10 meaning the axis should try to show roughly 10 ticks because D-3 uses

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,340
a special algorithm to make the ticks values as neat as possible.

32
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,760
The X is often one containing exactly the right number of takes that we ask for.

33
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,490
But at least try to be fairly close.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,970
We can use the take format method to choose how we want to display or take values.

35
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,370
We can do this with D-3 format which will cover in section 5 or we can use just use an anonymous function

36
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,660
which gives us access to the point that the tick is showing.

37
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,010
We can then apply some kind of transformation to it which will do for this section.

38
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,290
Finally if you get annoyed by the finicky nature of these tick generators then you can just pass in

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,300
the specific values that you want to display as an array with the take values function if you use take

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,790
values as well as tick format then the access generator will pass the values that you supply onto the

41
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,260
tape format method so that you can format these accordingly.

42
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,150
Let me take you through how this looks.

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:45,470
In the case of our chart first a right to access generators will use D-3 access button for x axis passing

44
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:52,310
and X scale and D-3 X is left for a y axis passing in a Y scale.

45
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,460
Next I'm going to group elements to our visualization area.

46
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:03,110
One for each axis for our x axis we're going to need to remember to translate this group by the height

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,100
of our visualization

48
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,700
and a Y axis will be in the right position already.

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,420
So we don't need to worry about shifting it

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:30,240
finally Arcola access generators on both of these elements with the Coleman.

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,990
So now we have two axes rendering on the screen as we expected.

52
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,560
Something to note here is that on our x axis our take values are overlapping each other to fix this.

53
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm going to apply a rotation to all of the text elements in the x axis group I'm using Select all here

54
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:58,110
on x axis group to get a hold of all the text SVGA that are Xs generators appendant for us for each

55
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,600
of the text SVGA inside that Access Group.

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm adding a transform attribute to rotate them.

57
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,700
We're applying a rotation transformation here.

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,510
In a similar way to the translations that you've already seen the rotate function just takes one arguments

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,560
which should be the number of degrees that the SVGA should be rotated in a clockwise direction.

60
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,880
So here I'm passing in a value of minus 40 means that all these text elements are rotated 40 degrees

61
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,170
anti-clockwise.

62
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,960
I've also moved these SVGA around with the x and y attributes.

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,030
So they line up with take marks and said that text and gets and is.

64
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,970
They all line up.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,370
I'm also going to fiddle around with the takes on the y axis to show you how a few of these methods

66
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,500
are working hair I'm telling otic generator.

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,610
I only want it to be three ticks and I'm using a special format function to show all the values and

68
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,750
metas.

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,610
All I'm doing is using this function to edit and character after age of odd numbers you can see that

70
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,670
D-3 reduced the number of takes to five here.

71
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,530
But it wasn't able to make the numbers work out with only three ticks for completeness.

72
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm also going to add in some labels to our visualization.

73
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:25,340
So the user can clearly see what we're displaying or just do this with some text SVGA for both axes.

74
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,410
Here's the code I'm using for X label.

75
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,300
I'm giving an x coordinate.

76
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,400
They'll put it in the center of the axis I'm putting is y coordinates 150 pixels past the end of our

77
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,150
visualization area so that it sits under our x axis take labels.

78
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,140
I'm also saying the font size and I'm giving text anger middle.

79
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,360
So it's a with the center of the page.

80
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:58,180
Finally I'm passing in the text of the SVGA should display using the text method for a wine label.

81
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,950
I've rotated it by 90 degrees so it's in line with the y axis.

82
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:11,850
I'm passing in a value of minus 19 which represents a shift of 90 degrees and the anti-clockwise direction.

83
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm also tweeting the x and y values so fit in the middle of axis because we're rotating the label the

84
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,850
same time.

85
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,820
Setting these values.

86
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,480
They look a little strange because we're reversing the X and Y positions of our label.

87
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,350
After this lecture you should feel comfortable with how the different access generators work.

88
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,560
And you now know about different commands that we have to edit.

89
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,450
Access takes you might notice that access seem to be upside down at the moment.

90
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,010
Can you figure out why this is happening.

91
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,990
We just have a few tweaks to make in the next lecture to fix a y scale at that point we'll have completely

92
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,750
finished the bcher you be ready to take on your first class project.
