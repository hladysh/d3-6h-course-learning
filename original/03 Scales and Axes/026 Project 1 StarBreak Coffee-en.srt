00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,880
In this lecture I'll be introducing you to your first class project and walk me through everything that

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,550
you're going to need.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,600
I'll also talk about some resources that you can make use of for building this visualization.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,240
You have a friend Paula who owns a burgeoning coffee chain called Star break coffee after opening half

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,130
a year ago.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,630
She's been collecting sales data in an excel file and has noticed the change has been growing really

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,280
consistently.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,200
She's heard that you've been taking this course and she wants you to make a simple batch of Web site

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,840
which is going to show to investors I'm giving you a project folder with everything you'll need to get

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,830
started in the index file.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,860
I've already set up the shape of the site for you.

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,690
There's a simple nav bar at the top of the screen.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,090
And I've given this site some basic styling for this project should be adding to this chart area to

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,760
live right here.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,900
I've also included your main G-S file and the D-3 library which you'll find in the JSE directory since

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,190
poler collected her sales data in an excel file.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,880
It's already in the CSA the formats required for the three seeis the function.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,140
You can find this file here in your data folder.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,260
Here's what your visualization should look like at the end of this project.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,280
Download the project folder and write some D-3 code to really bring this data to life.

21
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,130
If you get stuck at any point in the process then there are a few simple things that you can do to help.

22
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,350
First of all you can watch videos of the past two sections to see how we made a last batch it.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,490
This could be especially important at the start to jog your memory of all the syntax.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,340
If you come across a bug in your code you're really not sure what's going wrong.

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,050
Then it can actually be a really rewarding process to try to figure out the problem for yourself.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,690
I recommend making as many console logs as possible to make sure that your variables contain what you

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,980
expect them to.

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,080
If you can't figure it out by yourself then you can always ask questions in the comments section.

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,810
The activity that I or one of your fellow students will help you out.

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,000
Alternatively if you're completely at a loss and you can't figure out what's going wrong then you can

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,060
check out my solution to the project and get help.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,620
Which is also attached to the next lecture.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,410
You can then cross-reference between different files.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,310
Check out what could be going wrong.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,750
Good luck on your first project.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,530
It's a huge step to finally be making your first real visualization for the course.

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,750
We really start to add a lot of power into what we can already do with the three.
