1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:12,110
In this section you learn how to work with scales axes and margins to transform some basic shapes on

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,530
the screen into a fully fledged bartk.

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,680
This visualization was pretty basic but it should have helped you to learn some of the key concepts

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,730
in D-3 which will keep coming up throughout the course.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,860
The bar chart that we made the pool isn't actually much of an improvement on just the roll figures in

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,600
terms of explaining what's going on in section 5.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,720
We'll take this bartk to the next level by making it flick between different data sources.

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,520
In the next section you'll be learning about data visualization design which will be critical for more

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,590
complex projects.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,960
You'll learn how to tell what kind of visualization you should use for a particular set of data and

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,500
you'll be learning how to constructively critique existing visualizations to make them better.
