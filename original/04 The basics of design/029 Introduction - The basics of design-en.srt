1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,130
Now they know how to make some simple visualizations in D3.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,300
I want you to start to think about how you might apply this knowledge in your own field of work.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,650
Unlike most of the projects in this class your own projects will require you to create your own new

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,280
and exciting ways to express the data that you're working with.

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,020
Although the D-3 library really allows you to build anything that you can imagine.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,880
There are some best practices that you should be aware of to make it good fishless station in this section

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,550
I'll take you through the process of sketching out your ideas before launching into coding something

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,400
I'll help you to understand the different types of data and how to visualize them and I'll introduce

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,650
you to the bootstrap grid system for making responsive pages.

10
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,240
By the end of this section you'd have the knowledge to constructively critique existing data visualizations

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,690
and you should have the confidence to be able to challenge other stakeholders who have an interest in

12
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,210
influencing the design of your projects.
