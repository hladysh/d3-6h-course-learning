00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,460
In this lecture I'm going to be talking about some best practices.

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,270
Think about before you start to design any visualization.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,560
We'll be talking about tough to design principles which emphasize making clear and easy to read visualizations

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,350
and we'll be giving some examples of visualizations that do this well and others that do this badly.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,490
A key aim for data visualization needs to be to make the data as easy to interpret as possible.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,490
You want your visualizations to be credible because the last thing that you want as a designer is to

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,300
have your entire project discredited because the data was displayed misleadingly visualizations should

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,300
also achieve the aim of drawing attention to the data rather than anything decorative that surrounds

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,670
it.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,200
This approach is embodied by the work of Ed Wood who is an American statistician the pioneer in the

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,080
field of data visualization tough to emphasize four main principles that we should follow to craft a

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,910
clear and readable data visualizations all of which focus on staying honest to the data eliminating

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:19,540
distracting elements in terms of graphical integrity data can easily be skewed by its presentation.

14
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,140
Here we have a famous example in Fox News where they are using a distorted Y-axis to exaggerate the

15
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,430
difference between 35 and 40 percent.

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,680
The graph on the right conveys the data more truthfully and the effect isn't quite as shocking.

17
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,920
It's generally considered to be bad practice not to start your waxes from zero.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,280
For this reason it gives an instant shock impact but it throws the whole argument into question when

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,920
it's viewed in a critical light.

20
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,570
Tough to define the life factor as the size of an effect shown in the graphic divided by the size of

21
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,710
the effect as it's measured in the actual data.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,000
For a church with high graphical integrity this figure should be as close to one as possible and there

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,070
shouldn't be any inherent bias that skews perception a good example is shown here from a keynote speech

24
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,070
from Steve Jobs back in 2002 8.

25
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:23,600
The tilting Fredy pie chart makes the section at the bottom representing Apple's market share seem WAY

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,950
bigger than it really is

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,270
turf.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,990
Coined the term chart junk to mean any elements on the screen that distract the viewer from the data

29
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,400
whilst adding no extra information.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,790
We have another good example from Fox News here to illustrate a point.

31
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,210
In general anything Fredy background graphics or any of that unnecessary framing elements would be considered

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,810
as chaat junk according to the two if to uses the term data in Gratiot to measure the amount of charging

33
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,470
the visualization has here we have two expressions of the same data each which have different data to

34
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,080
anguishes top that would argue that the chart on the right here is far clearer as it gets the point

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,720
across more successfully than the chart on the left.

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,510
After this lecture you should feel primed to weigh different visualizations according to some common

37
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,290
rules for design.

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,450
This is an important skill to develop as a data visualization engineer.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,160
You should be able to justify your design decisions that you make to people who we are working with

40
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,980
and should have the vocabulary to constructively critique visualizations that can be proved.

41
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,590
However it's important to note that these are just guidelines.

42
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,500
Design is always a highly subjective matter.

43
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,030
In the next lecture I'll be making a counterpoint that these principles aren't always essential to make

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,740
visualization.
