00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,040
Although Tufters principles have been influential to many data visualization engineers there's still

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,040
a lot of debate about whether it's actually better to eliminate elements that they would consider it

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,250
as challenging.

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,460
In this lecture I'll be taking a closer look at this argument and providing some balance to his opinions

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,370
on data visualization design.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,590
When we think about what visualizations are used for our most important goal might not always be just

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,230
to communicate data in the most efficient way.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,260
Sometimes the most memorable visualizations are the ones that really grab the attention of the reader

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,370
and make them take a closer look.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,160
Especially when the visualization wants to tell a compelling story.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,050
This could be especially important as the goal could be to the reader.

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,010
The best way to do this might not be with a completely dull line or a bar chart that might use aesthetically

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,800
pleasing supportive elements compay what the data is showing.

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,880
This could call for a new and imaginative types of visualizations that people have never seen before.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,070
All of these factors aren't caught by his own estimation of what makes a well-designed visualization.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,510
For example here we have a visualization of countries that spend the most on military spending every

17
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,190
year.

18
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,940
There are certainly a few things wrong with this graph.

19
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,590
The graph is really a histogram rather than a bar chart which is generally a poor design decision to

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,660
make as our minds are bad at telling between different area sizes.

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,910
However this visualization looks far more interesting than if it was displayed as a minimalist but chose

22
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,030
another famous example here shows a creative adaptation to a line graph showing diamond prices.

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,140
Over time the graph has a terrible data to ink ratio and it's not even totally clear where the individual

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:10,250
data points are but how much less interesting with this specialization have been it being simpler.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,130
Finally here we have a visualization about campaign spending in the US.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,630
The visualization on the left screams Chad junk and might even have a bit of a life factor due to the

27
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,260
slanting x axis.

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,280
But would it be better or worse at drawing attention to the issue than the graph on the right.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,680
All of these charts so far a static infographics and not the sort of thing that you'd be able to create

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,090
with D-3.

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,000
But there is still some visualizations that give of a unique kind of interactivity which you can replicate

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,010
with D-3 For example this is a node linked diagram which is a really popular and interactive visualization

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,020
D-3 makes it really easy to create.

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,020
I'll be showing you how to build these in Section 8.

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,340
The bounce some of these circles could be seen as pretty distracting.

36
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,250
But what makes this type of visualization appealing is precisely the kind of quirky interactivity that

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,520
it offers.

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,510
It encourages further exploration of the data and it creates a novelty that will intrigue the user to

39
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,020
find out more about it.

40
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,130
With these examples in mind it's good to know that took these principles aren't always hard and fast

41
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,700
rules for data visualizations.

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,070
Design is a highly subjective field but you should still use your intuition to judge that element should

43
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,990
add to a visualization or whether it takes something at what in the next lecture I want you to critique

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,140
some visualizations that get to show you using what you know about the best practices for design.
