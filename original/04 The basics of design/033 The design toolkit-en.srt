1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,700
Now do we have an idea of what a good data visualization should look like.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,760
We can start to think about the different tools that we can use to display data in this lecture.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,490
We'll be looking at the various options that we have open to visualize data we'll consider color scheme

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,100
selection and we'll look at the different data types that exist and how to deal with them.

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,180
How do we think about the options that we have available for displaying data.

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,950
Jack betime propose a visual design space for us to consider the different design choices that we can

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,800
make for visualizations where we can choose between physician size gray value texture color orientation

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
and shape to convey different data on a page.

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:00,600
We can see examples of how these channels can be used to produce graphically differentiated images.

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,990
It turns out the we humans are better at judging between some of these channels than others.

11
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,650
Let me take you through an example hit.

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,150
I'm going to flesh some shapes on the screen and I want you to come up with a quick gut reaction answer

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,970
to the different questions that I'm going to ask.

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,360
You don't need to pause the video and I'll tell you the answers after about five seconds.

15
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,160
First up how much longer is Line B in line a

16
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,570
line B is four times longer.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,180
That wasn't too difficult right.

18
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:51,920
How much steeper is lying a than Line B.

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,650
The answer is also four times that one was a little trickier.

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,230
Right.

21
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,930
How much larger is circle B in circle.

22
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,210
A

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,090
circle B is five times larger.

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,300
It's particularly challenging for our brains to pick apart the difference between areas.

25
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,600
How much darker circle be than circle a

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,980
circle B is two times darker a little bit easier.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Finally how much greater is the value of circle B and the value of Circle K using this legend underneath

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,950
circle B actually has a value of four times greater than Circle A because Circle A has a value of two

29
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,650
and circle B has a value of eight.

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,710
This is a really tough one for us to figure out because we have a color scheme that diverges between

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,180
two completely different colors.

32
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,850
We have to put in a lot more mental effort to figure this out than if we were just looking at Douglas.

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,410
So from these examples we can see that makes a big difference.

34
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,970
Which type of visual channel we use to display our data.

35
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,140
Some of these data types will be easier for the reader to interpret that others and others will be far

36
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,120
more difficult.

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,620
Every piece of data falls into one of three categories qualitative ordinal categorical quantitative

38
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:44,280
data involves numbers of different sizes that just somebodies height weight IQ score or income categorical

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,770
data places distinct categories on each data point allowing us to compare between factors that we're

40
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,900
interested in ordinal data.

41
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,670
It's similar to categorical data except that these categories can be ordered by size.

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,860
So for example big medium and small are all distinct categories but they can be boarded so we classed

43
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,500
them as ordinal as opposed to categorical.

44
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,370
Here we have a simple cheat sheet to guide you in selecting the right channels to use the whatever data

45
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,530
you are using.

46
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:23,080
Typically we're best at judging position and length for quantitative data but worth the judging slope

47
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,590
angles and intensity for ordinal data.

48
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,710
It's best to stick to area bigger shapes stick out smaller shapes and we can find patterns in between.

49
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,520
For categorical data we should only ever break it down by shape or color as this emphasizes the fact

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,770
that each category is distinctly different.

51
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,310
In terms of selecting the right colors to using your visualizations you should stick to a fairly small

52
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,810
number of colors for categories.

53
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,870
If you're using more than 8 different colors then these colors will start to overlap and it will start

54
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,810
to get hard to pick them apart for quantitative data.

55
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,190
It's best not to use diverging color scheme such as going from red to white to green because then you

56
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,440
need to define a point as the white value.

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,270
And it's not as easy to tell points apart that are centered around that point.

58
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,950
Also you might want to consider selecting a color scheme that's easy to read for colourblind uses as

59
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,400
is a pretty simple fix and it should mean that about 1 in 20 users will now be able to make use of your

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,470
visualization a really simple tool that's free to use on line for selecting color schemes.

61
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,050
Killebrew which offers a variety of nice color schemes depending on the number of data points that you

62
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,260
have.

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,500
You can select for different types of data and you can also see a range of color blind friendly color

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,950
schemes for your visualization.

65
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,170
After this lecture you should understand the difference between the different Batal channels that you

66
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,630
can use visualisation and you should be aware of which channels best express the data you're working

67
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,970
with in the next lecture.

68
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,290
I'll be introducing you to the process of sketching where I'll be showing you some tips to get your

69
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,160
ideas expressed to something concrete on paper.
