1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,140
Now now you know a bit more about the design tools that you have at your disposal it's time to start

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,960
thinking about how he would apply them to your own projects.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,830
Sketches are one of the most important parts of a designer's toolkit.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,190
In this lecture I'm going to be teaching you huge create quick and simple drawings that you can use

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,380
to brainstorm some of the best ways to display data.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,750
Sketching is a really important part of any design process as it lets you test out how things should

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,620
look before you leap into trying to build something with code.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,110
As you start to sketch out different ideas you can get a feel for the type of data that you're working

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,960
with and you can test out some different options against each other.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,220
Sketches are also really important to communicate your design ideas to anyone else that has a stake

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,820
in your projects.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,490
It's a whole lot easier to discuss different options once they've been written out as a drawing.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,900
Here are three quick rules.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,460
I want you to follow whenever you make a sketch of a visualization you don't want to get too attached

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,800
to any one I did you come up with.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,150
So you should make all of your sketches at disposable as possible.

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,650
There's something liberating about the idea that you can just scrunch up a sketch if you don't like

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,260
the way it's going and just throw it in the trash for that reason.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,180
I recommend that you write your sketches on paper next.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,650
All of your sketches should be as big and bold as possible.

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,760
It can be a problem if sketches are too small so that you can't see everything clearly.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,790
So make sure that your sketches take up at least a half a side of a full paper.

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,280
Finally don't try to make your sketches a detailed representation of how your visualization should look.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,300
The idea with sketches is that you're just trying to get your general point across.

25
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,270
They don't need to be drawn with a ruler.

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,610
You don't need to worry about making things to scale and you should only have enough detail so you can

27
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,280
convey the general idea.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,670
You never want to be spending more than five minutes to create your first sketch of a visualization.

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,130
I'll take you through some examples of how the sketching process might look as an example.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's say that I want to visualize something about population and GDP per capita is of the different

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,750
continents in the world.

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,160
Here's all that I'm using to make my example sketches my sketchbook is fairly small.

33
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:42,320
So make sure that each of my sketches take up an entire page space an obvious choice to display this

34
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,850
data would be a world map by simply drawing out the constants with displaying positional data that shows

35
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,520
where each of these items are located.

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,560
We're also saying something about the size of each of the consonants and we can add data or on top of

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,200
this by changing the intensity of the colors to encode some continuous data so to quickly do that.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,650
I'm going to add in some dots on each of these consonants which quickly articulate this.

39
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,890
So here we could say that the darkness of the color that we're using for these continents represents

40
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,810
their GDP per capita.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,620
This is called a core uplift map which I'll show you had to make in Section 8.

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,710
You might notice this sketch isn't a particularly accurate representation of the consonants the sizes

43
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,000
and shapes are way off from what you'd expect.

44
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,850
But that's not the point.

45
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,090
The point is to make something quick and easy which expresses your basic idea.

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,030
For another example I've sketched out a sunbursts plot which is kind of like a pie chart except that

47
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,260
it allows for further breakdown of the data from was originally displayed.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,640
We'll be building these in section 9 each of these rings represent 100 percent of the world's population.

49
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,740
Breaking it down into different regional categories as we move further out the size of each of these

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,580
arcs is encoding that population label just a few of these auks to let the reader know what this visualization

51
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,320
is talking about.

52
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,890
Again I'll add in some marks to show the GDP per capita of each of these UCS.

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,490
This time using crosses instead of dots to show how some dogs should be darker than others.

54
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,280
You'll notice that this graph isn't a tool to scale as it's being drawn terribly.

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,650
Again the point is just to communicate how the data is going to be displayed and come up with something

56
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,330
quick and easy to communicate.

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,190
All right does

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,020
finally image do more or less the same thing with the treatment instead of a sunbath a tree map basically

59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,900
conveys the same information except that it comes in a rectangular shape instead of working with angles

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,610
the size of the rectangle should relate to each of these regions populations.

61
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,090
I boxed off the different consonants first and then I filled some of these in with a few example countries.

62
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,900
The scale is clearly way off since the U.S. is almost the same size as China.

63
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,200
But that's not the point.

64
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,680
You also see that I didn't bother adding labels for every country or even every continent because that

65
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,080
would have taken more time.

66
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,670
Again I'm linking the color intensity of each of these boxes to the GDP per capita.

67
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,030
I've also added in a legend here which explicitly tells us what the graph is saying.

68
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,210
After this lecture you should be prepared to start making sketches of your own to figure out how to

69
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,920
show your data.

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,900
I've gone through some basic rules that you should try to follow and show you how this process should

71
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,400
look.

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,390
Now that I've gone through a few different sketches to give you a general idea I want you to sketch

73
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,910
out some designs of your own.

74
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,770
I'll be giving you a Denno dataset to think about and you should use the design principles that you

75
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,410
learned in this lecture to come up with some ideas.

76
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,160
There really are lots of different ways to visualize data like this and I want to encourage you to really

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,330
think outside the box and see what fits best with this data.
