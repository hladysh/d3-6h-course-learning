1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,650
Over the course of this section you learn about some basic rules of thumb that should help you going

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,930
forward to design and build better visualizations.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,780
I'll keep coming back to some of the lessons that you learned in this section throughout the rest of

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,630
the course.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,640
In the next section we'll be improving on the bar chart that you made the Paullus coffee chain in Section

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,460
street.

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,100
Adding in some updating elements.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,990
This is where things get really interesting with D-3 as we can start to create some unique visualizations

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,830
that we can't really express in any other form.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,150
I'll also be explaining the D-3 update pattern which should hopefully clear things up with confusing

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,130
code that we saw.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,160
Now the data join in section 2.
