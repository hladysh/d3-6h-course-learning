1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,460
At the end of section three we end up with a static bar chart to show how poor Pullens coffee chain

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,530
has been doing in its first six months.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,440
We want to take that visualization and add some features onto it to make it more useful.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,830
One of the benefits of using these three is that it gives us the ability to add beautiful transitions

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,370
to our charts allowing us to switch up the data that we're looking at in this section.

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,230
I'll be teaching you how to use the D-3 update pattern and you'll get to see what D-3 is doing behind

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,150
the scenes.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,430
Using the files from a first class project will add the function that keeps updating the chart between

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,970
different sets of data.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,410
Once we've turned towards botcher into a much slicker looking page for investors will then be able to

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,740
see how we can easily update this bocher into a scatterplot.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,740
For us second class project by the end of this section you should feel comfortable with how the D-3

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,570
update pattern is working as you should know how to make a speed change react to a changing set of data.

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,210
This will give you a solid understanding of how the three works will make it a lot easier to design

15
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,070
and develop your own custom data visualisations from scratch.

16
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,790
You'll also have created a clone of a famous visualization from gapped mind which shows a bubble chart

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,360
displaying as different nations have evolved over time.

18
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,640
For this project you're actually creating something that looks really impressive as we start to unlock

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,440
the real power of these three.
