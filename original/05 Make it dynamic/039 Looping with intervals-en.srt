00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:12,250
If we want to add in some interactivity to our visualization class section we'll need to have some way

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,160
of refreshing the page to change something with chalk or react to specifically in this section will

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,920
be switching our dataset between two different data sources and having a bunch of data in this lecture

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,070
or running through the syntax between decrease interval function as well as the closely related set

5
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,000
interval function.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,810
Jay Querrey at the end of this lecture will have a loop running on a page that simply was a text console.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,550
An easy way for us to replicate and update and D-3 is for us to use an interval.

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,480
We basically want to run some code repeatedly every few seconds changing the data that we're looking

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,870
at.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,860
D-3 provides its own integral function for doing this which takes two arguments a function to run continuously

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,740
and the delay in milliseconds.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:08,020
The code inside this callback will run every five hundred milliseconds starting as soon as the browser

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,850
sees this code.

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,310
Let's take a look at how we would add an interval like this to our code.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,090
To start off I'm just going to write out the D-3 integral code at the end of our data loading function.

16
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,570
For now just to make sure that our loop is working I'm just going to make a console log for every time

17
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,080
the loop runs.

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,770
The second the argument of 1000 here means the program is going to wait 1000 milliseconds a one second

19
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,440
between.

20
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:50,560
Every time it runs let's refresh the page and take a look at the console as expected.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,720
We can see that our callback function is outputting the same Hello World to the console every second

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,070
in this lecture.

23
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,840
You learn the syntax to a really simple but powerful function in day which is going to help us to demonstrate

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,820
a lot of concepts in this section.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,120
Next lecture I'll be adding in an update function which will be calling in this interval to continually

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,100
update the state of our visualization.
