1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,210
Now that we can see what's going on with the D-3 update that's it.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,540
We're finally ready to make the update function actually change between different pieces of data.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,970
In this lecture we will be calling me up the function that we've been writing the last few lectures.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:27,670
Every time interval loop runs we'll be doing this by setting a flag variable which will keep track of

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,490
which data source we're looking at.

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,320
Let's take a look at our data inside our data loading function by using a console log here.

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,080
We can see that the data is currently split into two sections.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,310
The data are about profit and the data are about revenue.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,990
The profit value is still a string right now.

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,900
So I'll add a line in here to clean up this data.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,740
I want to be able to flick between seeing the revenue for the past six months and the profit for the

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,910
past six months.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,730
We'll do this by declaring a flag variable that set to either true or false when the flag is set to

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:14,310
true we'll use the revenue data and when it sets of falls we'll use the profit data first.

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,570
I'm going to declare a variable called flag with a global scope and initially set it to true at each

16
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,630
run of the loop.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,590
We're going to toggle the flag setting.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,970
The truth is currently false or false that it's currently true.

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,780
Then we're going to declare a value variable that will be set according to the status of the flag.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:41,040
The quickest way to write this is like this.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:48,010
I'm using the turnaround operator in javascript here which is a really handy shorthand way to use it.

22
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,930
Elssler basically whatever's on the left hand side of the question mark should evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,580
If it's true it returns the value on the left of the code long.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,840
And if it's false it returns a value on the right after we've made this change.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,210
We just need to make a few edits to make this work.

26
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:18,190
Or replace each of these revenue fields with the name of a value variable so that these values can alternate

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,730
between showing revenue and profit data.

28
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,350
Finally we'll change the value of a white label depending on what the flag says.

29
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,060
So here I'm using the term or the operator again to set the value of a label and then updating the label

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,390
text accordingly.

31
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,680
Now that we have all of this ready I'm going to refresh the page.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,270
And finally we can see the visualization is updating every second as expected.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,680
After this lecture you should feel comfortable going through a similar process to this day coming up

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,670
with a flag variable to flick between different data sources.

35
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,990
At this point we have a visualization that's starting to look more substantial and a dating automatically.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,830
However it doesn't quite look as clean as we'd really like it to be in the next lecture.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,030
I'll be introducing you to transitions in DS3 and by adding just a few simple lines of code I'll be

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,980
converting the visualization that we have now to something far more elegant and beautiful.
