00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,410
Pross second class project we're essentially going to be using a jazzed up version of a scatterplot

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,630
where the size of our circles will change depending on the time that we're looking at.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,180
This is technically referred to as a bubble chart.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,450
In this lecture I'm going to be making a few small tweaks to the visualization that we have now to make

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,850
it into a scatterplot.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,710
It's actually really simple to convert the bartk we have to a moment into a working scatterplot all

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,480
that we really need to do is switch our rectangles circles.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,640
So first rename what we're appending to be circles rather than Rechts.

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,730
And you'll recall that SVGA circles get their position from C X and see y attributes instead of x and

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,590
y attributes.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,250
We can make these changes was keeping everything else the same.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,170
Next we also need to get rid of the width and height attributes instead replacing them with a radius

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,380
attribute for a simple scatterplot.

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,750
We'll just give them a radius of five pixels when we enter them

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,750
if we refresh the screen now we'll see that we suddenly have a working scatterplot.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,260
You might notice here the circles are skewed a little bit to the left because of bend scale was positioning

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,430
our rectangle at the start of our bar rather than in the middle.

18
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:39,630
To fix this or add in half the length of bandwidth to the x value.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,130
Now this looks like a real scatterplot for making a bubble chart.

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,700
The radius of the circles will also want to change depending on the data that you give it.

21
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,890
You'll be writing a new scale to do this and you'll need to remember to associate the area of the circles

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,470
with the country's populations rather than the radius of these circles.

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,650
Now they can see how a scatterplot should work indeed 3 three you should be prepared to take on your

24
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,620
second class project in the next lecture.

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,530
I'll be introducing you to a second class project and taking you through everything that you'll be needing.
