1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,680
In this lecture I'll be providing an introduction to your second class project taking you through the

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,150
project files that you'll be working with and I'll give you that look at what the finished project should

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,010
look like.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,990
At this point in the course you should have a rough understanding of how D-3 update pattern is working

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,490
to handle updates on the page.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,060
If you're a second class project you'll be able to put this knowledge into practice and get a good feel

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,490
for what you should be doing.

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,800
The second class project involves making a clone of a famous visualization from Gap minder which is

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,860
an organization dedicated to challenging conceptions between how we think the world is and how the world

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,520
really is.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,380
According to statistics you should take a look at the YouTube video which is linked to the start of

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,550
the next lecture to get a feel for the context behind the visualization you'll be creating.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,800
You'll find the starting carried in the zip file attached to the next lecture.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,970
Again I've already set up the index to aged email file and provided you with all the files that you

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,540
should need.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,140
This project you should work in the main js file in the JSE directory.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,640
I've also included copies of the D-3 NJ queried libraries and your JS folder.

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,660
Let's take a quick look at the data set for our project.

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,010
Since the file is so big I'm just writing a quick Consolo get the data once it's been read into the

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,070
main jast file.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,690
What we have here is an array of each of the different years of data you can access the year that you're

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,390
looking through this year value and the country's contains an array of objects representing each country

23
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,360
in that year for each of these countries.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,990
We then have it's consonant its name is GDP per capita life expectancy and population.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,440
The year that we're looking at I'm going to provide you with some instructions for how to get started

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,070
with this.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,570
I recommend starting off with just making the visualization in the first year of your data and then

28
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,070
worrying about adding an update after that.

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,690
Once you have completed this project you should have something that looks like this.

30
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,400
The data is updating continuously on a cycle between all the different years in our dataset at each

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,670
point in time.

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,530
The size of our circles is changing to reflect the country's populations and the position of the circles

33
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,180
are changing to reflect the GDP per capita life expectancy as we mentioned back in S. history when using

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,290
a log scale here.

35
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,760
So you can see we're looking at Ballys for 400 then 4000 than 40000.

36
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,510
We're also using an ordinal scale here to separate circles by their constant.

37
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,330
If you find yourself still trying to find figure out any of the syntax.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,720
Then once again you can absolutely flick between different lectures in previous sections.

39
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,710
You need to review the process of working through issues by yourself can really help you to understand

40
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,420
what's going on a lot better.

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,470
And again I'd strongly recommend you to make console logs whenever you can and claim what's going on.

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,070
Finally if you have any problems that you can't resolve by yourself and providing my solution of the

43
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,000
cost and you can check your work against it you can also post questions in the comments section of the

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,810
assignment page to ask questions to me or to any of the students.
