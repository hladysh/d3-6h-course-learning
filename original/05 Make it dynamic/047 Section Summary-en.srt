Congratulations to finishing this section you created a powerful visualization that communicates an

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,190
important message.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,230
You've had your first experience using the complete D-3 uptake Baten which is gradually starting to

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,520
make more sense.

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,060
And you've had experience using D-3 transition to seamlessly update the data.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,710
You also now know how to use in topos and D-3 to create loops in your visualizations.

7
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,590
The concepts that we covered in this section are some of the most difficult to understand in D-3 if

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,330
you're feeling comfortable with the update pattern syntax that we've explored so far then you're well

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,770
on your way to becoming a D-3 master.

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,660
But if this all doesn't make much sense yet then don't worry.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,580
With practice you gradually come to understand how the different parts of the data reliably come together

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,860
to afford you a powerful level of flexibility in what you're able to do.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,740
We'll be building on this project in our next section to add interactive features so that users can

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,390
pause the visualization.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,230
Choose the time that they're looking at with a slider and filter out different continents.
