00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,380
The visualization that we ended up with at the end of last section lets us see a nice overview of how

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,480
this data is changed over time.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,030
However the visualization will be far more useful if the user could explore the data with some more

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,930
advanced features over the course of this section.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,510
I'll be introducing you to a variety of extra components that will gradually allow the user to do more

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,850
without visualization.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,830
We'll be using event handlers and listeners to update the visualization as they use it interacts with

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,670
different elements on the page.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,940
And by the end of this section you should feel comfortable with implementing a host of that interactions

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,550
and attaching event listeners to SVGA use on the screen.

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,940
Finally will use your new skills to develop an interactive line up your third class project.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,670
The project involves displaying historical prices at different crypto currencies and gives you a chance

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,790
to really experiment with some common interactive components.
