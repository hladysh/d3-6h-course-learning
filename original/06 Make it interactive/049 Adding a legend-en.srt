1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,870
So looking in the visualization that we built at the end of last section we actually can't tell for

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,000
sure which consonants we're looking at before we get into handling user interaction.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,190
I'm going to take you through the simple process of adding legend to your charts.

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,890
This will also give us some more experience working with espying.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,540
JS This time using them to break our code into a better more reusable structure.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,480
We're going to be adding a group to contain the whole legend then a group to contain the legend rose

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,720
and then for each legend Rowe will be adding a text SVGA to the relevant label.

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,000
The square with the right color to make things simple since we only have four different consonants to

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
worry about.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,050
I'm just going to hard carried a list of consonant names for us to work with.

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,840
First of all writing group to contain the entire legend and then shift it with a translation so it sits

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,160
at the bottom right of up actualization.

13
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,180
Next I'll use a For Each loop on our list of constant names to append each of our Legin bro groups.

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,380
Are stored in a variable so that we can append to it later and then give each of these rows a translation

15
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:30,450
so they don't overlap amusing the index for a For Each loop to do this so that each of our rows are

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,750
separated by 20 pixels in the wide erection for each of these rows I want to append a colored square

17
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,730
and a text SPG with the name of the consonant.

18
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,000
So for starters I've added a rectangle with the height and width to 10 pixels for each run of the loop

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,910
giving a fill of the color return from an ordinal scale on the name of the consonant that we're looking

20
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,720
at.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:03,180
Finally I'm going to append a text SVGA for each of outros of even the text an x value of minus 10 and

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,110
the text anchor.

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,960
And so the text gets appended to the left of squares and they're given a y value of 10.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,640
So the text lines up vertically.

25
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm passing in the string of a constant name that we're looking at.

26
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,300
The text method and I'm also using the style method here to capsulize each of these strings.

27
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,940
Since they're in lowercase a quick know about the difference between the style method and the actual

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,650
method here.

29
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:41,770
The style method is used to set CSSA styles of SPG and D-3 sometimes styles can also be attributes such

30
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,970
as field stroke stroke with incapacitate but not all styles can be set as attributes such as the text

31
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,640
transform style.

32
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:57,370
You'll often see Antara in style used interchangeably but realize that sometimes you need to use one

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,490
rather than the other.

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,470
Now once we go back to our browser we can see that a legend is working as expected and we now see what

35
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,460
each of the colors is representing.

36
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,970
Hopefully this lecture was useful as a refresher to think about what we can do with groups he'll often

37
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,040
be using legends for your visualization.

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,500
Whenever you are using a color scheme and it's helpful to have a simple process to work through making

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,480
them because the way that we've written this code it should be easy to copy and paste this lecturn to

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,960
work with pretty much any chart that you need.

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,240
In the next lecture I'll be introducing you to formatting and parsing in d 3 which would be really important

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,150
for working with time series data and which will also be using in the following lecture.

43
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,990
When we add tool tips to our chart.
