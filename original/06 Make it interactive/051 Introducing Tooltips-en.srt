1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,790
Although a graph now has a legend that lets you see the consonant that each of us relates to.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,900
It might be useful for our users to view the broad data from a given country in a given year.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,910
It would be nice if the user had some way of following one of the circles over time and finding out

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,720
which country it represents.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,130
In this lecture we'll be adding some tool tips to a graph what this means is that the users will be

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,650
able to hover over one's circles with their mouse and the box will appear giving all the information

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,870
to relate to that particular data point.

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,040
To do this we'll be making use of the D3 type library which is the third party plug in that somebody

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,310
from the D-3 community is designed to work with these three.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,770
We'll also be putting on newfound knowledge about formatting into practice to make our data appear in

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,460
a tween and readable way.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,360
At the end of this lecture we should have a tool kit that looks something like this hovering over Italy

13
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:12,580
here the user can see a nice clean display which shows country name continent life expectancy.

14
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,130
GDP per capita population in the current year.

15
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,370
Here we can see the sin taxes involved in adding a tool to it.

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,000
Firstly we are calling the D-3 tip function D-3 tip libraries giving us which instantiates our tool

17
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,040
tip element we're adding a class called D-3 tip.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,020
The aftermath which will take care of styling and then we're saying the constants of our two tape and

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,540
the AGM element we're using a function head to separate email which is going to get past that piece

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,260
of data from the shape that we want to look at later on.

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,160
In Step 2 we are using the cool method on our visualization to let our Page know that we want to attach

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,420
a tool tip to our visualization area.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,700
Finally we're adding to event listeners to ask veejays which is saying that the torture should be shown

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,530
when the mouse moved over the shape and the tool tip should be hidden.

25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:16,050
When the mouse moves outside of the area of the shape tip show is actually relaying the piece of data

26
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,860
associated with the Eski G to the h t m l function from step 1.

27
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,120
Whenever the mouse over event is triggered

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,850
this is a good point to mention the on method in D-3 which is used for attaching events to the cheese.

29
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,600
The method takes two arguments an event type to listen for the function to run whenever that event is

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,280
fired.

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,510
The tooltip uses the mouse over and makes out events but there are a huge number of different events

32
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,700
that we can listen for the functions that we're using for a tortured tool to hide and tooltip those

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:01,420
show which are methods that the D-3 library gives is to effect the elements display we'll be introducing

34
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,850
a number of other event listeners in the next few lectures as we continue to make our visualization

35
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,550
more and more interactive.

36
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,840
The D-3 temp library also comes with some simple examples C Ss which will be using to give us some quick

37
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,000
and easy styles for taught it.

38
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,850
Now that we've seen the syntax for creating a tooltip in the three I'm going to walk through the example

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,240
of how we would go about adding a tortilla to a bubble chart.

40
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:38,210
As D-3 tape has a plugin library for D-3 it doesn't come included with the regular D-3 library.

41
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,310
She will normally need to download it from its repository and get her include included in your ingenius

42
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,930
folder.

43
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,650
As I mentioned I'll also be grabbing the examples C S S file from the same repository so that we don't

44
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,360
need to worry about making anything look pretty.

45
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,350
I've already gone ahead and added these files into my project folder and I included them here and in

46
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,420
my index to H.T. mail file.

47
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,340
Going back to a manger file here we add a tool tutor to our visualization for the first that we need

48
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,690
to initialize the tooltip by calling the D-3 test function.

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,660
Here's what this code will look like.

50
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,870
I'm giving it the class of D-3 test which matches the CSSA name for an AC SS file and I'm going to set

51
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,380
the mail with a function.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,480
For now I'll just return the object that we're looking at and I'll come back to setting the HDMI out

53
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,150
later.

54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:44,030
Next I'm going to use D-3 is called method on our visualization group to set the context for our Toltec.

55
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,830
Finally I'm adding in the two event listeners that we need to use the tools to work properly.

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,520
First there's the mouse over events where we need to show the tool tip by providing the tip top show

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,860
method as the function.

58
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,430
And secondly we need the mouse out-of-band which we use to fire the Tip-Top hide method.

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,510
I should note that we're attaching these events before we merge into selection with the update selection

60
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:19,010
because we only want to attach these event listeners once for every circle that we enter onto our.

61
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,930
Now when we go back to our browser we can see the tooltip appears when we hover over one of these circles.

62
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,480
However we still need to format the content of our tool tips age Jamail so we can actually see the contents

63
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,610
of this object.

64
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm going to go back to when we first initialize the it and write out some HDMI code for us to display.

65
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,170
We're actually going to make a fairly long string hit output inside out towards it because we have so

66
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:54,440
many fields that we want to display to make our structure clearer and making a variable called text

67
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,930
and adding to it one line at a time.

68
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,610
I'm starting out with a country name here.

69
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,320
I want all of my variable names to appear older than the pieces of data.

70
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,600
So I'm surrounding each of them with a strong tag for other pieces of data.

71
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,970
I'm coloring them in red.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,210
So they really stand out with this span tag and setting the text color with an inline C says when it

73
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,100
comes to actually including the data.

74
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,920
We're using some string concatenation here for the first row we can access the country name using the

75
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,890
key of the country from our data object.

76
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,860
We're also adding a brake tag here.

77
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,070
So every piece of data it will display on its own line.

78
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,540
Next we're doing the same thing for the continent.

79
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,860
The data point belongs to.

80
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,720
I just copied and pasted the same line for my country field replacing the word country with consonant.

81
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,080
Again I've done the same thing with life expectancy using the life XP field.

82
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:02,000
GDP per capita with the income field and population with the population field finally and returning

83
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,570
this long text variable which is what actual tape is going to display when we refresh the page.

84
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,770
Now it looks like a tooltip is doing what we want it to.

85
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,090
However these figures look a little messy as they are.

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,050
So we'll use some format functions to clean them up.

87
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,680
First off I want to capsulized the names of our continents so I use the same text transform trick that

88
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,980
we used for our legend to capitalize these names.

89
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:37,090
Next I'm going to add a D-3 format call for life expectancy data or life expectancy data is sometimes

90
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,400
given to one decimal point and sometimes given to two decimal points in our data.

91
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,940
To clean this up or make a specifier.

92
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,730
To format this figure as a floating point value to two decimal points from the D-3 documentation I can

93
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,730
figure out that we need to provide the precision before the type for a format and specify that we're

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,900
ultimately looking for the string of point to an I'll do something similar if the GDP per capita.

95
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,610
Except this time I'll use the specifier dollar column as the rope and the Dollar Sign here tells the

96
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,630
three that are using a currency.

97
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,950
The comma adds a thousand separator and the zero error gives as a fixed point number with no decimal

98
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,480
points.

99
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,580
Finally for population I'm going to use the specifier comma 0.

100
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,700
This should do the same thing as the last format function.

101
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,850
Except here with not formatting a number as a currency once you refresh the page and take another look

102
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,570
at tooltip again we can see that our data is showing up in a much nicer format than before.

103
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,510
One thing that's pretty annoying is that the circles are constantly moving so it's hard to get a clear

104
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,530
look at a certain country but will be introducing a fix for that in the next lecture.

105
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,400
After this lecture you should now be able to add your own tool tips to your visualizations using the

106
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,850
three step process of initializing metod it calling it in the context of your visualization and adding

107
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,580
its event handlers to us.

108
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,220
Geez you also got your first look at event listeners in this course when we added listeners for Mansingh

109
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,080
over the way from the SVGA circles in the next lecture we're going to be adding in 3 new interactive

110
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,980
features to a graph including a pause button so that users can take a look at the visualization in a

111
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,090
set and yet because we'll be listening to so many different events at once.

112
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,080
We'll also be introducing an event handlers to simplify our logic.
