1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,220
At this point although users can pause a visualization on this year it can be annoying to have to wait

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,420
for a whole year to roll around to view the world at a certain point in time.

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,930
By the end of this lecture we'll introduce a slider where users can pick up the exact year they want

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,860
to look at.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,120
I've decided to use the j where you find library from slider in this project.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,680
This library has a plugin library that works on top of Jey query and it allows you to add a few different

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,850
features on a separate page.

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,900
We didn't need to use j where you slide this project and we can just easily abused that bootstraps it

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,120
that this slider also gives you the option to select a range of two different values instead of just

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,010
one.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,960
This will come in handy for a third class project.

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,340
So I will introduce it to you in this lecture.

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,550
Here's what the syntax looks like to create a slide.

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,420
After we select an element with J Querrey we can add a slide to it by running the slide method which

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,970
initializes the slide on the page.

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,670
We can pass in a variety of different options.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,740
Here is the object which gives the slide as some initial setting.

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,950
Here with setting the max option is hundred men option 0 meaning that slider will be arranged between

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,370
zero and 100.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:39,560
The step option hand means the slide it goes up into the corner and so one the range option determines

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,680
whether or not we want the slider to be a range slider.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,470
If it's set to true then I slide it will have two pointers which can be dragged to set two different

23
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,320
values.

24
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,840
The value option sets the initial value that the slider is set to.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,760
If we were using a range like that here and would want to use the values option instead which would

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,420
take an array of two different numbers.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,400
Finally we can add event listeners to us light up by setting a value for the different slider events

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,840
that we had to choose from the start of and fire.

29
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:20,090
When the slide first begins that new the stop event fires when the slider is released and the slide

30
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,890
event fires.

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,250
Every time slight changes.

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,350
We could also use the change event which would find it when the slide moves to something different.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,620
We can use a function head to dictate what should happen when the event is fired.

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,150
These two arguments that the function takes is access the event that find that function as well as the

35
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,580
State of the slider through this UI variable we can access the current value of the slider which will

36
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,330
be used to update of visualization.

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,660
Now that we've seen how the syntax for us slide should look.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,290
I'm going to add one to our bubble chart.

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,130
I started off by adding a couple of lines to a DML file which will give us some where to put the slider

40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,760
on the screen I've also added a label which will display the year which should match the Year at the

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
bottom of the screen.

42
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,490
I've also added Jay Querrey UI library here which I downloaded into my drafts folder.

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,630
Now in our main file I'm going to initialize the slider on a date slider div using Jake where query

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,580
wise slide a method.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,780
I know that our data ranges between 8500 in 2014 so use these values to set the min and max from the

46
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,110
slider I want our users to be able to select any year in the dataset.

47
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:51,390
So we'll set the step to one and we want to update our visualization whenever the slider moves.

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,240
So we'll set a handler on the slide event in the event handler function here.

49
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,480
Although we want to do is to change the value of a timer to match the data we use and move the slider

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:09,980
to we can get a hold of the year that the user selected using the value method this variable and we

51
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,700
can minus 8900 from it translate it to the index of our data array.

52
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:22,900
For example if we said eighteen hundred here then we'll set the time to zero which will show the data

53
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,370
from the first year in our dataset will also run update function at this new time of value in case we

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,500
want to move the slider when the visualization is paused.

55
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,810
We also want to update the slider label whenever the visualization updates.

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,640
So we'll just add in a quick line at the end of the function so that the label always gets the same

57
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,430
value as the label at the bottom of the chart.

58
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,090
Finally as the visualization updates we want the position of the slider to gradually slide to the right.

59
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,390
So a Adeline at the bottom of the function to do this recall that we can change the value of the slider

60
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,660
using the value method like this.

61
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:11,580
And again we're just passing in the same time variable the same as label after we've added in these

62
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,240
changes.

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,240
We can see that we can select any data we want manually and we can see that this behavior works whether

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,900
or not the visualisation is running at the end of this lecture.

65
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,850
We've once again improved our user interface allowing users to look at the world in any of the data

66
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,260
set.

67
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,240
You should now be able to add a J query slider to your own projects which you'll get the chance to do

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,430
in project 3 in the next lecture.

69
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,430
I'll be teaching you how to build a line charge in D3.
