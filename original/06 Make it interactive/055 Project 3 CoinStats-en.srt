1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,010
In this lecture I'll be introducing you to a third class project where you'll be making a line chart

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,640
display historical cryptic parts of prices for different coins.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm going to take you through the template files that I'll be giving you know show you what you should

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,400
end up with the End of Project.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,250
You have some friends who are thinking about getting into cryptocurrency trading looking for any excuse

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,750
to show off your dazzling new data visualization skills.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,620
You decide to help them out by creating a visualization to show them how different coins have changed

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,310
price over time.

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,910
You want them to flick between the five biggest coins in the market in terms of market capitalization

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,500
you find some historical dates or a line they've already converted it into a useful folder for each

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,540
coin you have data for every day that's been trading showing you its price in dollars.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,310
The trading volume of the past day and its current total market cap.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,750
I want you to make a line graph that can show any of these metrics for any of these coins.

14
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,260
The graph should also let the user narrow down on a specific date range with the graph automatically

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,900
adjusting so that it takes up the whole screen.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,740
Here's where your project should look like once you're finished I can look at stats for any of the different

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,760
coins with the drop down on the left and I can set the y axis to the price in dollars.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,140
Total market capitalization or 24 hour trading volume using the dropdown on the right.

19
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,440
I can also choose to look at a specific date range using this Jake Query.

20
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,450
I slide it on the left.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,570
Notice that this time we're using a range slider so that we can choose the interval between two different

22
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,590
dates both the line and the access transitions smoothly.

23
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,990
Whenever the graph gets updated Here's the code I'll be giving you to start off with for this project.

24
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,500
As usual I've taken care of the basic set up for your index to H.T. M-L file including all the libraries

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,850
that you might need to use.

26
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,360
I've also written in a div to put your slide into with a date label on top of it and I've given you

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,670
two select boxes one to select the coin that the visualization should show.

28
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,290
And the other to select the variable on the y axis.

29
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,450
I've also made some changes to the C S file that comes with the project.

30
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,950
So just changing the color of the garish purple line that came with the original code.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,830
In your data folder you'll find one file that came with your example in this example that Jason File

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,100
and the coins data that you'll be using in the Coinstar js file.

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,410
Since you've already had the experience of writing everything from scratch in your previous two projects

34
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,710
I'm starting you off with the community written line graph code that I showed you in the last lecture.

35
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,210
In this project your main goals should be to adapt this starting code changing the source of data and

36
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,450
figuring out how it should update when our selections change.

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,950
This will mirror the kind of work that you'll be doing in real world D-3 development as it is extremely

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,220
rare that you'll ever need to write this kind of code from scratch.
