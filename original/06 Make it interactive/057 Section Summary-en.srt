1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,880
Well then at the end of this section you've built something pretty substantial.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,940
You've made a production quality line graph which updates seamlessly when they use that place around

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,330
it.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,510
You can now configure a host of different elements to trigger updates on a graph.

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,530
Now you've had experience of doing this with some common examples.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,080
You should hopefully be confident of wiring any kind of interactive elements up to a visualization like

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,710
this.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,300
The process gets a little trickier when we have to worry about multiple visualizations on the page updating

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,910
at once in Section 10.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,530
Once we separate our code into different files and to start thinking about visualizations as javascript

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,950
objects will start to introduce some more robust event handlers which will be triggered by multiple

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,160
events.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,730
In this section you also had your first taste of things to come where I took you on a crash course of

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,940
line graphs and D-3 although we don't have time to go through every visualization that we can imagine

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,710
over the course of the next three sections I'll be giving you the tools for finding pre-written cared

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,150
for what you want to build your self and how to understand how this code works.
