1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,210
Now you have a good amount of experience with using the D-3 library.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,720
It should be pretty easy for you to understand what's going on in a D-3 file.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,350
So for whenever you introduce you to a new visualization I've had to step you carefully through the

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,050
process and show you how to write everything at in the real world.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,630
You should never do starting your projects with empty files in almost every visualization that you're

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,130
likely to create.

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,700
There's probably someone out there who's already created something similar.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,950
The process of physically writing this code out for yourself was useful for making you more comfortable

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,190
with what different functions are doing in D-3 But now you should get used to adapting your code from

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,990
others.

11
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,130
In the next three sections I'll be introducing you to 11 new types of visualization.

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,560
Instead of writing these visualizations myself I did what you'll be doing now.

13
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,930
Going forward I looked up the visualization that I wanted online and they copied the files they wanted

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,410
onto my local machine.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,410
By the end of this section you'll know how to read somebody else's D-3 code to get a quick overview

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,670
of what's going on.

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,920
You'll know where to look to search for the visualizations that you're looking for and you'll be aware

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,760
of some of the nuances that come with dealing with different versions of the three.
