00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,940
One of the best things about the D-3 library is the buzzing ecosystem of developers though already using

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,780
it in this lecture.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm going to show you two of the best sites to check out to find helpful boilerplate code that can get

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,330
you started writing visualisations.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:29,010
I'll be using these sites myself over the next three sections to find the different example implementations.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,360
I'll be walking you through the reason why I've structured these next few sections as a series of crash

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,420
courses in different visualizations that you never really want to be writing all of your code from scratch

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
unless you're coming up with a new kind of visualization which is totally revolutionary to anything

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,300
that's come before.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,780
Then you can be completely certain that some other code exists on line that you can adapt for your own

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,350
visualizations.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,350
For D-3 we have two great Web sites blogs dot org and block build a dot org which make it easy to appropriate

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,460
small useful chunks of other people's code for your own projects.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,750
I'm going to show you blocks first.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,220
The idea behind blocks is that you can share snippets of D-3 code on line showing the code and the output

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:26,720
in your browser blocks is maintained by Mike Bostock who is one of the creators of D-3 and he's uploaded

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,760
many of the most commonly used visualizations out there.

18
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,520
On the home page you can see a list of the most popular blogs and generally speaking if you Google something

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,060
like bar chart code D-3 an implementation in blocks will probably come up near the top of your search

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,380
results.

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,050
So for example here we have a blog with the code building and tree map which will cover in section 9

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,510
on the top of blocks is another site called block building org which lets you edit someone else's blog

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,650
with an online editor meaning that you can basically make a fork of someone else's visualizations because

24
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,690
of this you'll find lots of code snippets on block builder that take something that's already been done

25
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,400
with blogs but has a slightly different twist to it.

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,070
So for example if we use the same you around that we would just on except with block build it instead

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,210
then we can edit it like Bostock's code directly in this window and things will just automatically update.

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:35,640
So for example I can change the width from 960 pixels to 500 pixels and the graph changes accordingly.

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Did you sign up with an accountant block Builder.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:46,300
Then he can also save the changes that you make inside the editor and you can force changes into a repository.

31
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,960
The best thing about block builder is that you're able to search through the catalog of code snippets

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,140
that users have upload a lot of times if you're looking for a fairly unique visualization.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,150
Many of the best implementations might still only exist in older versions where you can do here is only

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,870
search for visualizations that use D-3 version for for example let's say that we want to find a bar

35
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:20,030
or in Version 4 we just type what we're looking for in the search box and we find one that we like.

36
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,050
So here's an interesting visualization where we have a diverging scale depending on where the data is

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,180
positive or negative as you can see.

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,260
Most of these files just have everything on the page a male page rather than splitting things up into

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,750
different javascript files.

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,480
As we've been doing your first step finding the visualization that you're looking for should be to separate

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,940
things out a bit into the files and from that you want to adapt the visualization to fit with your own

42
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:56,650
data using what you know about the D-3 update pattern and then handling from Section 5 and 6 in this

43
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,560
course and then be able to make static graphs of data based on the events that you care about.

44
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,680
After this lecture you should be aware of the different sites that you can use to find new types of

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,220
visualizations or be using these two sides repeatedly over the next few sections to source our example

46
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,860
code.

47
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,370
And I'd highly recommend that you take a look at then to check out the wide variety of prepared code

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
which you can download for free.
