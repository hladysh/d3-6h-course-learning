1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,420
In this lecture I'm going to be talking about changes that came with the latest version of the three

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,990
version five we'll be showing you how to deal with them.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,990
We'll be taking you through a quick example of the visualization that we've already seen to show you

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,640
exactly what we need to do to convert any file to version 5.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,880
When this course was first published we were working with version 4.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,610
So all of the videos in the next three sections assume that we're still running on that version.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,020
Since this code block building still won't be updated for a while now I figured that it's easier and

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,470
more useful for me just to take you through the process of switching code over rather than redoing all

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,300
these videos from scratch.

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,500
The good news is that there's very little that we need to worry about with the switch over to version

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,290
5 for what we cover in this course.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,910
We only really need to worry about two major changes which can cause version of apps to break.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,630
Firstly we had a restructuring of D-3 data loading functions.

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,430
These functions now use promises rather than asynchronous callbacks to load in data.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,420
We covered this already back in Section 2 and this change also meant that we don't need to use QS in

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,090
D-3 for loading multiple sets of data.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,160
More on that later.

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,780
Secondly one of the old color schemes was removed with the D-3 chromatic library being installed in

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,780
the core build of the three instead.

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,140
Apparently some of the colors and D-3 scheme catch twenty scale with two similar and that might make

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,310
it seem like it was some relationship between categories that wasn't really there.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,510
Let me take you through a quick example on block builder of how we would go about converting some version

23
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,380
for code to version 5.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,110
Here we have a pretty contrived example of a simple but John blocks with everybody getting a different

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,700
color.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,040
This gives me a good opportunity to really show off the power of this online tool and actually use the

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,420
editor which I won't be using for the rest of the course.

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,470
We can actually view this code side by side with what gets rendered in the browser window which is a

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,180
really nice feature.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
We can see here that the script is using version 4.

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,200
Instead include in the script tags if we change this line right here it's come from the latest version

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,190
then we'll immediately see page breaks but nothing showing up on the screen.

33
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,740
Notice that block build up automatically updates this browser whenever we make a change which is also

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,870
really nice.

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,410
The first step for updating code to version 5 needs to be to look for any data loading functions and

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,790
convert the syntax that we've been using for promises.

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,350
We also have some error handling here in case something goes wrong when we try to load in a file we

38
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,270
are using this optional first argument in version forth to do that which will handle differently in

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,450
version 5.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,560
We'll get rid of it now and we'll come back to it at the end.

41
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,100
First of we just need to tuck this callback function here.

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,090
The argument for the then method and suddenly we can see a buzz again.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,100
They're turning it black.

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,310
What's happening here.

45
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,330
We're going to see that right here on line 22.

46
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:28,560
We're making a call to D-3 scheme catch 20 which no longer exists in the D-3 library.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,200
We just need to replace this color scheme with any one of the three other color schemes to get it to

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,130
work properly.

49
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,720
If we go to the D-3 API reference which is a vast resource for anything about D-3 then we can find this

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,330
page on color schemes that we have to choose from.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,780
You can see that the category 10 schemes still exists in version 5.

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,540
And in general we have a huge selection of options to choose from.

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,450
I'm going to go for D-3 scheme past the one which looks nice and then we just need to go back and change

54
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,030
this line right here to get it to work.

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,360
Finally the error handling.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,560
We just need to define a catch method for a promise in case a promise is rejected.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm just passing in an anonymous function here and we'll just log out whatever the error message is

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,680
say to the console.

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,260
And that's it.

60
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,200
This is all we need to do to get our visualizations to work with version 5.

61
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,820
We already have them in version 4.

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,030
After this lecture you should now be able to take a walk cruise over the last three sections one step

63
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,480
further to they work with version 5.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,030
You'll need to do this with your own projects at the D-3 eco system.

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,370
It can be quite Sloat de-tox example to the latest version.

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,620
This isn't too much of a process especially considering how tough it was when converting from Version

67
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,770
3 in the next lecture.

68
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:01,970
I'll be introducing you to the concepts of layouts and D-3 these functions and a set of different fields

69
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,760
that the data that we're working with which we can use to quickly build a certain type of visualization.
