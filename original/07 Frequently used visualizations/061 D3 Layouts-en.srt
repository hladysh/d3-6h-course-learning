1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,760
In this lecture I'm going to be introducing you to lab functions and D-3 which can be used to quickly

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,070
create all kinds of different visualizations.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,610
I'll be walking through two different examples that will see over the next three sections to show you

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,260
how these functions work.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,670
It's good to understand what these functions are doing because they give us the power to create a whole

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,830
host of common visualizations that would otherwise take a lot longer to figure out.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,480
The basic idea behind the lay out is that you can call it on the set of data and the magic of the layout

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,600
function will spits out the same data with a new set of fields for each data point.

9
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,180
So just where this particular item should be placed on the screen we can then use these values generated

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,720
by our lab function to set attributes of a SVGA is all we can plug them into some kind of path generator

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,540
to draw something on the screen.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,250
If you ever find yourself looking at some legacy code from the trees version 3 then you should be aware

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:19,080
of the difference in the syntax that exists in version for the only difference is that version of four

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,960
transitionary used a flat namespace.

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:30,960
So D-3 layer PI became D-3 pi the three layer force became the three fourths J2EE last stack became

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,470
D-3 stack and did really trim it became just D-3 trauma.

17
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,780
This final one here which we're covered towards the end of the section is a plug in lay out from our

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:49,940
community that generates word clouds this namespace didn't change between version 3 and version 4 because

19
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,770
it's maintained outside of the main D-3 library.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,550
So what do these lab functions do exactly.

21
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,450
Here's an example that we'll cover later in this section where we're formatting our data using D-3 is

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,630
pilot.

23
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,150
We're starting off with an array of data in this format here on the left.

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,750
If we initialize a pi function in our code and call it on this data and this gives us the output on

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,320
the right we still have access to our original item in the data field.

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,900
So here again we can see accounts of 200 fruits of oranges and the rest region of east.

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,210
But now we also have a set of new values attached to each item in our

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,880
So here are pi function is looking at the Campfield for each of these items in the data and it works

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,520
out what the start and angle need to be.

30
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,970
Each of these values to make a full pie chart will then be plugging these values into a path generator

31
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,610
to draw each of the arcs of pi if we wanted to figure out the value of these parks ourselves.

32
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,860
Then this could have been a pretty tedious process.

33
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,870
We need to write some special kind of functions that looped over our array added these values together

34
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,230
found the ratio of each of these values to the total and then converted these values to be read in radians

35
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,180
for a graph as common as a pie chart.

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,680
It's helpful that D-3 comes with an easy way to figure out these values for us.

37
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,080
Here's another example that will cover in section 9 where we're making a treatment we're passing in

38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,890
the data in this format on the left and our treatment plan is spitting out the values on the right.

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,940
Each of these 220 browes is representing a category that we want to display.

40
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,020
This time the data that we're providing on the left is actually the output from a different layout function

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,320
which formats the data into a hierarchy.

42
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,550
We can see that feeding this array of values into the treatment function.

43
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,910
We set up gives the same array of values just with some x 0 x one y one and why one feels

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,670
for this visualization all that we need to do is to append the rectangle for each of the rows in our

45
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,450
data and set that positions based on the coordinates the treatment function at it and for us it will

46
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,340
be a nightmare to try to figure out how to make each one of these on your own.

47
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,080
It really matters that rectangle rectangles in the same category a place together and there's a lot

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,200
of complex math going in to formulate the position of these areas.

49
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,790
This is the kind of chod the D-3 layouts are really useful.

50
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,540
Somebody has already done the hard work of implementing this layout already which handles all the complicated

51
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,440
stuff like figuring out the right spacing out for them is to use.

52
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,380
We just need to understand format the data should be in and get the syntax right for using them.

53
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,670
You know visualisations at the end of this lecture you should have a basic understanding of what let's

54
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,120
do it.

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,980
The three I've shown you some examples of how these functions mutate the data that we pass into them

56
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,860
and you'll be well-prepared to encounter some of these different labs in the next few sections in the

57
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,720
next lecture.

58
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,670
I'll be giving you a crash course on area charts and giving you a walkthrough of an example in notation

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,870
from somebody in the D-3 community.
