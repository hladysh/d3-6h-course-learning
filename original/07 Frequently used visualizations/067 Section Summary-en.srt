00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,580
At the end of this section you now have five new types of visualization.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,070
They are able to express with these three I've taken you through a quick tour of different people's

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,060
code covering a few topics that we've just glazed over before.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,880
And at this point you should be starting to get the hang of the process of quickly understanding what

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,550
D-3 file fits together and you should feel like you could afford any of the visualizations that we've

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,000
covered already and adapt them into your own data.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,310
Importantly you also learned about how lappets work in D-3 attaching a set of attributes onto the data

8
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,800
that we're trying to work with.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,580
And I'll be showing you some more examples of these over the next two sections as they're making the

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,550
job of building more complex visualizations a whole lot easier.
