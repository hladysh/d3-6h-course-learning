00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,430
In this section I'll be giving you a broad overview of how we can draw maps in D-3 maybe sharing everything

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,860
that you'll need to take into consideration.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,230
You learn about the different projection algorithms that we can use and will be introducing you to the

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,830
D-3 Jiyu path generator.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,220
You'll also be learning how to work with MAT files in D-3 also be showing you how to use D-3.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,080
Q module to load multiple datasets at once which will be really important going forward whenever you

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,110
want to switch sources of data together.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,840
Finally I'll be teaching you the ins and outs of the D-3 force that will be using it to create one of

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,310
the coolest visualizations that you can make with D-3.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,710
When I have a node linked diagrams at the end of the section again the focus of this section is all

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,410
about running through community code and building up understanding of how the D-3 files fit together.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,660
I'll be moving through the examples pretty quickly.

13
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,740
Just aiming to give you a breadth of knowledge that you'll need to quickly pick up any visualisation

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,380
that you can find online.
