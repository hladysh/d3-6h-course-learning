00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,270
At the end of this section you now know how to build two of the most impressive visualizations that

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,530
D-3 lets us create these visualizations for showing maps and networks.

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:24,470
A pretty tough to create in most other systems but they're actually fairly easy to build with D-3.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,700
You've also had more experience interpretating some boilerplate code from the community as I've been

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,440
going through our examples line by line again to understand how everything is working.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,090
You will find yourself using the D-3 Q module a lot if you keep doing D-3 development because you always

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,450
want to use it when you want to work with data which is spread across multiple different files.

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,840
The next section will be the final crash course section that I'll be taking you through.

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,140
I'll be covering everything to do with hierarchical data and I'll be showing you how to build for new

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,670
visualizations which will express something about hierarchical systems.

11
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,710
I'll be helping you to format your data so that it will work with these layouts that will use.
