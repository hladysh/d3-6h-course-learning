00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,300
In this section I'll be rambling off the second part of the course which involves plowing through a

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,880
whole range of different visualizations each of the visualizations and this section involves hierarchical

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,850
data.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,500
What this means is that we'll be communicating something about a system where different elements in

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,740
our data that can be thought of as belonging to others.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,720
So for instance we might want to communicate the structure of the business.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:43,670
There's a chain of command stretching from every lowly employee way up to the company's CEO using the

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,760
visualizations in this section we could compare how individual employees are adding to the overall performance

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,360
of that teams as well as to the civilians of the company as a whole.

10
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:03,370
Another good example of hierarchical data could be geographical entities such as continents nation states

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,160
and districts.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,190
Every district belongs to a state.

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,250
Every state belongs to a nation and every nation belongs to a constant.

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,840
We can make some interesting visualizations that play on this hierarchical structure compared between

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,860
these separate entities.

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,740
By the end of this section you'll be able to format your data properly to work with these lay outs and

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,290
you'll also be able to add tree diagrams treatment circle packs and sunburst plots of growing visualization

18
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,010
toolbox.
