1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,930
In this lecture I'll be introducing you to the circle packing lab that comes with three this type of

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,800
visualization is really similar to a treatment and you'll see parallels in our code and you'll see parallels

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,830
in how our code is written between this lecture and the previous lecture.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,690
We're once again using the D-3 stratify lay out to set up data.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,310
And this time I'll be introducing you to the D-3 packed Ladd's

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,980
circle packing can be used in any situation where you might think about using a tree map instead.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,460
You could argue that the circle packing offers a more unique and interesting design than a regular treatment.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,720
It all three groups is categories more explicitly than just by using a single color scheme.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,440
However to play devil's advocate here you could also argue that it's more difficult for our brains to

10
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:09,200
text areas between different circles than it is for us to pick apart the areas of rectangles.

11
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,140
It's really just a personal design decision that you'll have to make by yourself as to which visualization

12
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,500
you want to use.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,040
On the left you can see the same data that we saw in The Last Lecture visualize with circle packing

14
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,340
instead of the treatment.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,450
Again the areas of each of these shapes represent the population of different countries which are split

16
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,520
up into regions the example on the right.

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,910
Here is a visualization.

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,920
I'll be walking through in this lecture to keep things simple.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,740
Here we have another visualization that I found blocks using the exact same dataset that we've seen

20
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,780
in the last two lectures.

21
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,290
This time data is in the format of a table again.

22
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,240
So we'll be using D-3 stratified Wrotham deep hierarchy.

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,550
We have a nice effect here where we can hover over each of these circles and the stroke gets changed

24
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,700
so we can clearly see which packages inherits from.

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:14,380
We're also using a nice color scheme where the darkness of each of these circles represents the height

26
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,650
of each node.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,210
So our root node on the outside representing the entire floor library has the darkest color.

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,390
And these leaf nodes over here with the most ancestors have the lightest color.

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,210
So let's start looking through this code to see how everything is working.

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,190
The way that we're getting our color scale to work for this visualization is by using a sequential scale

31
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,220
together with this interpolator for colors that D-3 gives us basically the zero value for this interpreter

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,850
is in the middle of this set of colors.

33
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,630
And since we're saying the domain between minus four plus four we'll be using some of these colors in

34
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,090
the middle of the chart.

35
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,360
So next we're using the stratify layout suggest hierarchical order.

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,880
Each of the rows in our dataset all this line is doing is providing the access a function to each node

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,600
in a network to connect with its parent here we're setting up a pact that we're just passing in the

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,000
size that we wanted to take up and the padding value which represents a bit of padding that we want

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,420
to surround inside and the outside of every circle.

40
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,080
Again I'll make some console logs here to show you what layouts are doing.

41
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,510
First of all we have the raw data that we're loading it all the way we have to start with an ID for

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,690
each package which we're used in first position in the hierarchy and the value sharing the sides of

43
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,720
each package.

44
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,990
Next we're setting up our written word here by passing in our data to a stratified function.

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,740
We're summing up our values based on each element value field and we're sorting out elements by this

46
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
size to.

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,000
So this spits out hierarchy format that we now know and love which we'll be able to pass on to any of

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,390
our layout functions.

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,420
Once we call our pack layer on this Ruge object data we add in x y and our attributes which we use to

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,800
position our circles.

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,730
We're performing our data join here on the descendants of our root node which gives us this array here.

52
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,980
For every descendant we're adding in a group which we're translating according to that it's X and Y

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,520
about these lines.

54
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,560
Setting up a nice hover effect where we get to see all of the nodes ancestors whenever we mouse over

55
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,440
it then we're adding a circle to each of these groups setting the radius with the value the layout function

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,690
provided us with.

57
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,810
And we're saying Phil accordant the depth in the hierarchy again this code here is just making sure

58
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,050
that we have some tidy labels that we can use for each of our nodes and we're leaving at the leaf nodes

59
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,760
because they're too small to read labels from.

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,710
Here again we are using the same simple tool tip from a treatment.

61
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,280
And finally this is the function that we're using to set the hover effect of each of us circles when

62
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,870
we mouseover a circle.

63
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,480
This how the value gets set.

64
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,210
True.

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,100
So for all of the nodes ancestors we're setting a class of node Hubner using this class method.

66
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,340
And then when we miss out the hover argument takes on a value of false and then we can remove the class

67
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,070
that we gave to these ancestors.

68
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,530
After this lecture you should feel comfortable working with the circle packing lab that Dietrich Gibbs's

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,320
for making this type of hierarchical visualization.

70
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,610
In the next lecture I'll be taking you through your final crash course in this class where I'll be introducing

71
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,180
you to the sunders plot which is a unique display of data to show splits in the hierarchies of multiple

72
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,730
levels.
