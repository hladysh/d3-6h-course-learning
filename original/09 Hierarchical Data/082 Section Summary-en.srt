00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,080
Congratulations the step that you just took in the last activity should hopefully have given you a lot

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,450
of confidence going forward.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,010
You can now apply the skills that you first developed in the first six quiet sections of the Course

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,880
to understand adapt and improve.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,150
Any kind of visualization in this section I introduce you to a range of different visualizations revolving

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,750
around hierarchical systems.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,450
These visualizations are some of the most eye opening displays of data out there because they give us

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,290
a broad overview of how a different part of the system fits together in the next section.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,370
I'll be returning to the visualization that we made for a third class project.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,990
We were visualizing cryptocurrency prices over time.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,770
We'll be restructuring our project files to clean up our code.

12
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,120
I'll be rewriting visualisations as objects to make them more usable.

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:10,660
And I'll be adding multiple visualizations to the page at once which will all connect together through

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,950
common events Hanlon's.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,680
This will pay you for your final project where you'll be making a fancy data dashboard for a large conglomerate

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,180
company.
