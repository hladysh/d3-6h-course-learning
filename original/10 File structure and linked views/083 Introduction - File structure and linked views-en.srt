00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,350
In this section I'll be introducing you to some best practices to help you to structure your code for

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,630
large projects.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,260
I'll be taking you through the process of splitting up your code into different sections.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,830
And show you how to write each of your visualizations in an object orientated style.

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,160
This will make it possible to add many visualizations onto the page at once but keeping your code understandable

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,520
and it'll also help you to start writing more reusable code that can copy into future projects.

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,870
Over the course of this section I'll be improving on I coin's that site we've made for a third class

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,440
project adding in some visualizations to complement what our graph is showing at the end of this section.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,090
You'll be putting together what you learn throughout the whole course to build your final project.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,570
I'll be starting off with some template community code you can find on line and you'll be going through

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,200
the process of gradually building up a powerful interconnected page.

12
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,550
This will be a production quality data dashboard which is designed to be used by a manager to assess

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,070
the performance of a company's sales team's.
