1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,340
In this lecture I'll be adding in two more visualizations to a graph and I'll be showing you how to

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,180
deal with event listeners that should affect more than one element on the page to do this.

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,710
I'll be writing events inside a manger file which will act as the controller file that communicates

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,770
between all of the visualizations on the page at the end of this lecture we should have a more advanced

5
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,360
page where visualizations can seamlessly communicate with one another.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,610
Here's how I want our sites to work when we want to link multiple visualizations on the same page.

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,790
Each event listener that we register inside one of visualizations is going to map to an event handler

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,140
which will live inside a mange s file.

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,630
This will allow us to update the state of multiple visualizations at once.

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,490
Since that all accessible from our main js file these event handlers inside a major file will act as

11
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,850
a go between.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,840
Meaning that we can make events happen inside the visualization impact all sorts of visualizations on

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,240
the page structuring our code like this will make it easier for us to express what each of these events

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,420
should be doing so that we can read facts or events to work as efficiently as possible.

15
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,870
Here's what I want us to end up with at the end of this lecture.

16
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:35,560
I want us to have two donut charts which will show the market capitalization 24 hour trading volume

17
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,870
of each of our coins in the present day.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,790
If I click on any one of these slices then I want my graph to update to show that coin I'll be changing

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,180
the fill opacity.

20
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,780
Each of these slices whenever the selection gets changed and I still want to have the same effect when

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,370
changing the coins using the select box at the top of the screen.

22
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,730
So I also want that event update the correct coins color color to start off with.

23
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm going to draw the two donut charts that we'll be using.

24
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,430
I've created a new file here which contains all of us Donat CHUGG code and I've included this in my

25
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,250
index page to nail file down.

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,540
Hit.

27
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,630
I've also changed of the structure of my age to male so that two thirds of the page will be taken up

28
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,130
by a line chart with the remaining third allocated to Donat charts.

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,270
Here is the file that I'm using to define the donut shop class which will be using created down charts

30
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,420
in the constructor function.

31
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:42,060
This time I'm passing in this variable argument and just telling charts what variable it should be showing.

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,880
We're also using this value in this method when assessing the value method for a pilot.

33
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,850
So this is just an access a function that the value method will use to tell which field it should look

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,360
at in the Wrangel data method.

35
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,890
Just grabbing the name of the coin that we're looking at from a coin select box.

36
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:09,350
Then I update this method we're using the same update function that we saw back in Section 7 for our

37
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:15,640
data join this time we're using a global data array called donor data which I've put together in a major

38
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,330
s file.

39
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,140
Here's where we are setting up the data to be fed into a donut chards we're making use of this for loop

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,810
that we already made to loop through every coin and we're just pushing an object.

41
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,420
This Donat dates here which we defined at the top of the file within passing in the most recent data

42
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,240
point that we have for each coin in the data field and in making a log down here to show you what this

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,080
looks like.

44
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,760
We can see here that our data is now in a format that we can use without Pylades.

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,500
We have an array of objects one for each field and can access different values using this data field.

46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,570
Now that we have all of this set up I'm going to add in two new instances of the donut shop.

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,850
I'll add one chart.

48
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,090
Each of the diff that we setup passing in the field should display.

49
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,250
I also need to remember.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,530
And these variables in at the top of the file so that we can access them later when you add events to

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,890
them.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,260
One last change that I'll make is that at the same color scheme we're using for a donor chart.

53
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,300
The color path in a line show that is more obvious which coin we're looking at.

54
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,470
To do this or remove the color scale that we defined in our donor chart and I'll add it to the list

55
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,750
of global variables in our mange file.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,090
We also need to change its name when the calling here or otherwise will again error and then in a line

57
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:49,810
of file I'm just going to make the color line come from this same color scale passing in the coin that

58
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,380
we're looking at once we refresh the page we can see that we now have three visualizations on the same

59
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,810
page and that the color of our line should match whichever coin we're looking at.

60
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,490
Now let's think about which events we want to add to our site to link the visualizations together.

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,720
Here's a list of all the new events that we need to incorporate whenever an artist gets clicked on one

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,530
of the charts then that we selected should become active.

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,870
For a visualization This should also trigger an update to a line chart to show the new coin and it should

64
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,080
also update the value of select bugs then we also want to add an event to a coin select box so the active

65
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,800
coin is not doing that chart of dates when we change the value here.

66
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,140
Of starts off by adding a click event for my donor charts.

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,410
I'm using that method as usual.

68
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,790
Added listen to each of these paths as they entered and I'll just call a function called.

69
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,330
Clicked which are right in the main file.

70
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,550
If I just leave it like this then I should be able to get a hold the item in data that is associated

71
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,580
with each of us slices.

72
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:10,060
So going back to a main file now after I've written out this function with an argument then this de-value

73
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,480
will give that item in its own data array as we can see here.

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,530
I'm going to be using the name of each point form the updates that we're looking for.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,980
Firstly I want to update the value of our select box with the coin that it should show Next they want

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,660
to trigger an update to both of my Donat charts.

77
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,720
And finally I want this to update all line jobs.

78
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,500
Once we refresh the page we can see how this is working.

79
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,950
The final thing we need to do now is also up.

80
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,390
They don't add charts whenever a select box gets updated.

81
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,830
We can do this by simply copy and pasting these two lines in our event handler.

82
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,020
You might think that repeating yourself a little here since we're calling at least 3 update functions

83
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,060
in two different places.

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,550
We can do some refactoring at this point to clean things up a little by just bringing these lines into

85
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,620
a separate function.

86
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,350
I'm calling this function color change to make it obvious what it's doing and I'm firing it and each

87
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,970
of these places.

88
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,290
So now once we go back to a browser you can see that all of the events are working as we wanted them

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,310
to at the start of this lecture.

90
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,540
After this lecture you should be starting to get the hang of converting visualizations into the object

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,200
oriented style that we using to structure a pages.

92
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,580
You'll often find yourself going through this process from working with new visualizations but the payoff

93
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,460
is huge Once you already have these visualizations in the format that you want them in.

94
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,690
I've also taken me through the process of adding in events to update things between different visualizations

95
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,060
creating event handlers within Manger's file which coordinate things across a visualisations in the

96
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,900
next lecture.

97
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll be talking about brushes and D-3 which allow us to select ranges in a different way than we've

98
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,080
been doing so far.
