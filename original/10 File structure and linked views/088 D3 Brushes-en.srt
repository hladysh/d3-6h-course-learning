1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,550
In this lecture I'll be introducing brushes and D-3 which offer as a way to make a selection by the

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,060
drag of the mouse for this course we'll be using brushes to create a context and focus effect for our

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:25,570
visualizations allowing users to get a closer look at a particular part of that data while keeping track

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,510
of how it fits with the rest of the graph.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,130
By the end of this lecture we'll have added a connotates graphed the line shot that we've been working

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:39,360
with in this section this lecture should also give you some experience with handling events across objects

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,940
as well as adding some more events and uprush selection links to each of the components on the page.

8
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,380
Here's what we're trying to build with a brush by the end of this lecture we've added in this smaller

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,500
area charts at the bottom of the screen which is showing the same data as a line graph.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,070
When we drag a mouse over this area we can select a range of data that we want to show a mange.

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:11,500
We can also pan this box over the extensive graph to pick a certain possible data to show and we can

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,360
change the size of this box by dragging its corners.

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,600
This is a nice interactive way to pick a date range for a graph which is more playful and interesting

14
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,450
just using a regular Jane queery you slider.

15
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,220
You'll often see this graph at the bottom referred to as the context graph.

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,160
Since it's fixed axis means that it will always show the broader context of what our charts are telling

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,190
us.

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,840
The main graph is then referred to as the focus graph since it shows a focused view of the data at a

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:53,410
particular range and time we put this graph together by using D-3 brush generator after creating an

20
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,820
empty group and calling a rush function on it.

21
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,870
D-3 will add these elements onto our charts.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,060
We have an overlay which we can drag a mouse over to reposition our brush.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,710
We have a selection area which is the shaded box that shows what we have selected.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,760
And we have two handles which we can play around with on either side of our selection to fine tune the

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,310
parts of the graph that should be shown in focus chaat for this course will only be using one dimensional

26
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,510
brushes meaning that they're only selecting an area on the X axis of a context chart we can follow a

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,670
simple three step process to add a brush on to any chart that we using.

28
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,950
Firstly we need to clear out brush generators somewhere in our code where we can select properties like

29
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,290
the size and position of the brush and how we want the brush handles to look next.

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,630
We need to run our brush generates it by calling it on the context of our visualization.

31
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,540
This should look similar to how we created our axes and G-3 as we'll just be adding a group Halman onto

32
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,030
our visualization and then calling the brush function on that finally we'll need to add an event handler

33
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,230
onto the brush event so that whenever the brush change position so that whenever the brush changes positions

34
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,430
we can update our focus chart to show the data that we've selected.

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,260
Starting off with the code that we had from the end of last lecture or shared the steps that we need

36
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,230
to take to add in this other graph to our visualization I've made a few changes already in the index

37
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,980
file I've added in another div after a line chart to contain a context chart which I'm referring to

38
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,360
as our timeline area.

39
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,430
I've also included the javascript file in O.J.'s directory which is going to set up the context chart

40
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,170
in my line of file.

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,740
I've decreased the height of the visualization a little so that everything fits on the page.

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,600
And in mange as file I've added an instance of a timeline onto a graph.

43
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,150
Let's take a look at our timeline file looks like.

44
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,700
This should all seem pretty similar to the code we wrote for our line up we giving the show a width

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,760
of 800 pixels which matches the width that we set for our line shown in the other file and I'm keeping

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,360
the left and right margins the same so that our graphs will line up vertically on the page we're adding

47
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:28,370
in some simple axes We're adding up paths for the first time and then in our update method we're updating

48
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,320
our scales and redrawing area.

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,490
Pat The main difference with our line chart is that we're not filtering out data based on the position

50
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,500
of update rate slider meaning the X-axis will always show the full extent of our data.

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,420
The coin that we're looking at.

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,480
Let me take you through the process of how we would add brush to this chart.

53
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:56,930
Firstly have written out the brush generator that I want to use the fact that we are using brush ex-school

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,750
rather than the Jaric brush cool means that we're explicitly telling D-3 that we wanted to create a

55
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,910
one dimensional brush that goes in the x direction.

56
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,740
And using the extent method here to define the minimum maximum coordinates the brush run between.

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,690
So this means that D-3 will create an overlay for a brush that runs from zero zero points of our visualization

58
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,320
area.

59
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,800
All the way down to the bottom right corner of the SPG grid.

60
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,470
This means that the user is able to draw a brush over any part of the visualisation area.

61
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,540
The next step is that we need to call the brush in the context of our visualization.

62
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,080
I've done this in the same way that we usually call the Xs generators on that visualization.

63
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,300
I just attached a group to our visualization area giving a color brush and I'm using the call method

64
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,010
to run uprush generator.

65
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,120
If we go back to a browser now we can see that this brush has been added to a context graph but it isn't

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,600
doing anything to a page yet we still need to add an event handler to a brush so that we can update

67
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,020
a line chart when the brush moves around.

68
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:14,280
I've added in this event handler to get the behavior that we're looking for whenever the brushes moved

69
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,750
we getting hold of the pixel values of brushless selected using this selection variable if the selection

70
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,120
is empty as it would be if the user clears the brush by clicking inside the brush area.

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,670
Then this value will equal the whole range of our scale.

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,860
We then calling the invert method of our timeline's X scale to give us the date values that this points

73
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,650
relate to then we're changing the values of our slider to match these dates and updating our line of

74
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,130
recall that the Rangle data method of our line job is sorting out which dates to show based on these

75
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,040
values for our slide.

76
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,050
So we don't need to do anything else to get the focus effect that we're looking for.

77
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,280
Finally all that's left to do is to go back and add in a call to brushed whenever a brush event fires

78
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,450
on a brush.

79
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,300
We're attaching the on events or the brush generator rather than the physical brush component here just

80
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,080
the brush component actually returns the entire group.

81
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,660
The brush gets added to once we refresh the page we can see that our line chart is now automatically

82
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,230
updating based on the selection that we're choosing.

83
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,500
However we still need to add in a few more events to a page.

84
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,990
For one thing a timeline chart should redraw its path whenever we change the coin or the variable that

85
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,160
we want to look at.

86
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,950
I also want to say that our brush component should update when we move the position of a query slider.

87
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:49,780
Since these controls are doing the same thing to the domain of a line chart to update context chart.

88
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,510
Whenever a coin or a variable changes it's as simple as adding in a call to our timelines Rangle data

89
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,580
method.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,000
Whenever either of these events get fired I'll add in one call right here inside of variable listener

91
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,030
and I'll add another one down here in our coin change function which will up.

92
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,970
They are chart when Iraq coin select boxes change or when a tuna char X gets clicked.

93
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,800
Finally it's a little tricky it's updates up brush component whenever we want to but they slide around

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,410
here we're calling out is move method on the group that it was attached to.

95
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,560
We need to pass in a set of values which match the pixel positions that the brush selection should run

96
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,780
between.

97
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,310
We're starting off with our date values which we had originally and we're using this map function to

98
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,530
feed each of them into our timelines.

99
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:49,290
Scale this spits out the pixel values that these dates would take on a timeline and then we using those

100
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:57,160
to set the values of a brush I've then move the current dates date labels into the brushed function

101
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,030
since this quarter the brushes move and also fire the brushed event.

102
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,390
Once we refresh the page we can see that everything is working as expected.

103
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,170
Adding in this brush with the context chart lets our users keep hold of the bigger picture was still

104
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,420
able to zoom in on a particular point in that graph.

105
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,230
There are many other interesting uses for brushes that exist within the world of D-3.

106
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,200
But this effect is a particularly powerful tool which can often take a simple chart to the next level.

107
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,180
After this lecture you should understand how to use the D-3 brush function to implement a focus and

108
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,360
context effect for your visualization.

109
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,490
You'll be making one of these yourself and your final project as part of the data dashboard then you'll

110
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,090
be building.

111
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,850
You should also be starting to feel more comfortable working with visualizations that are spread across

112
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:56,500
multiple different files linking these views together to form a more fully interactive page in the next

113
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,970
lecture.

114
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,470
I'll be helping you to get set up with your final class project where you'll be creating a data dashboard

115
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,660
to help a company to keep tabs on employee performance across different sales teams.
