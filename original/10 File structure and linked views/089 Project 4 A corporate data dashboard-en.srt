1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,130
In this lecture I'll be introducing you to your final project in this course where you'll be building

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,990
a data dashboard for a large American company as usual.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,890
I'll be giving you some background on what the project involves in this lecture and I'll be taking you

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,200
through the files that I'll be starting off with

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,400
for your final project.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,370
I'll be asking you to imagine that you've been headhunted by an executive from a freedom called one

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:42,350
of America's largest companies to build the data dashboard for their sales teams freedom Corp. specializes

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,610
in selling all kinds of wholesale goods to companies across the nation.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,760
They sell raw materials like planks of wood and bags of cement to construction companies.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,150
They sell TVs and computers to electronic stores they sell fridges and washing machines to household

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,690
appliance stores and they also sell a range of furniture to a few different outlets.

12
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,190
The company has been going through a tough phase over the past year or so and they want to find out

13
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,910
which parts of their business are doing better than others.

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,940
Their sales team is split between four different regions of the U.S. and for each region they want to

15
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,820
be able to see how their stats compare between them.

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,630
You've been given a file containing information every sales call that was completed by each team in

17
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,920
2017.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,690
Freedom Corp. wants to see how you call duration revenue perk freedom Corp. wants to see how call duration

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,110
revenue per core and the number of units sold has been changing throughout the year.

20
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,040
Here is what you'll be building over the course of this project.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,600
The main part of the dashboard will be this stacked area chards here which we can zoom in on by brushing

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,880
on the context graph at the bottom of the screen.

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,190
We also have four charts on the right which is showing summary data for the date range that we've selected.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,960
This time your code wants to take an average of each of these metrics.

25
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:17,290
Every time the date selection changes let me take you through the code and starting with in your index

26
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,030
file I've set up the page as usual with a bootstrap grid.

27
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,850
Hey we have a label to display the date range that the user selected with the brush.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,720
And here we have a select box where the user can choose the variable that should be shown on the main

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,990
graph.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Here are the divs that you'll be using to attach to your stacked area chart and your context chart and

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,620
here's where you'll be attaching the four other visualisations.

32
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,710
I've also included five javascript files which will need to build this site in the main file I've just

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,690
loaded in the data set that you'll be using for the project.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,330
Logging this and that console as you can see we have 5000 rows of data showing all of Freedom Corp sales

35
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,840
calls from January to December 2017.

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,860
As usual you'll need to perform some operations on this data as soon as it gets loaded and this page

37
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,400
should handle all the data loading for the page.

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,440
Create new instances of each of our visualization objects and contain all the events and global variables

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,860
that your page will use.

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,080
For your donut charts I'm giving you the file that I created over the last two lectures which already

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,080
counted in Opie's style you want to convert this code so that you can make a stacked area chart object

42
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
in your main file.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,640
And again you'll need to make a few changes so that it fits with your data.

44
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,520
Similarly I've included the time line.

45
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,040
Yes file that I was using in the last lecture.

46
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,450
You also need to make a few edits to this to use it for this project.

47
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,510
For your stacked area chards I'm stuffing you up with the code that I watch through back in Section

48
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,100
7.

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,610
You want to convert this code so that you can make a stacked area chart object in your main file.

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,840
And again you'll need to make a few changes so that it fits with your data.

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,670
I've done the same with your batch file taking an example implementation from Mike busto that I've found

52
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,550
on blocks.

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,560
After this lecture you should be ready to get started with this final project which should help you

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,590
to cement your understanding of all the different topics that we've covered.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,950
If you're feeling a little uneasy or any of the syntax that you'll need to build the dashboard then

56
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,830
you can always flick back to earlier in the course and re watch some of the lectures you might find

57
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,620
that re watching the lecture about stack area charts and Section 7 will be particularly helpful for

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,130
getting started with the main graph that you'll be building if you get stuck.

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,220
And as always you can either leave questions in the comments section or check out my solution on get

60
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
up.

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,880
However as always I would always recommend that you should try to solve these problems yourself first

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,660
using any resources that you can.

63
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,870
However as always I would recommend that you should try to solve these problems yourself using any resources

64
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,470
that you can find online to help you on this project.

65
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,580
You'll often find yourself using both the D-3 API reference as well as community code from Brox to figure

66
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,790
out exactly what's going wrong with your code.
