00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,260
Congratulations.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,280
Great job.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,730
After finishing your final project you're now at an advanced level with D-3 where you can handle complex

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,700
data visualization projects all by yourself.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,820
The data dashboard that you just built wouldn't look out of place on a real companies web site you'd

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,430
synthesize the knowledge that you've been gradually building up throughout the course which is culminated

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:39,050
in a really impressive set of base ations this section was focused on the challenge of handling multiple

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,230
visualizations on the page which introduced you to writing your visualizations as objects using the

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,360
project structure that we've been using together with this object oriented approach.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,980
It should serve you well going forward whenever you start to tackle visualization projects of your own.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,820
In the next section of your wrapping up the course running through a broad overview of everything that

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,650
we've covered and summing up with a few final thoughts.
