Great job! After the finishing up that last class project you're now able to do some really impressive stuff

1
00:13.110 --> 00:19.770
with D3. You've show that you're able to handle complex interactions between many different components

2
00:19.830 --> 00:25.830
on the page and you've built something that could easily be adapted to form the building blocks of any

3
00:25.830 --> 00:26.970
data dashboard.

4
00:28.150 --> 00:33.880
Beyond that you should now feel comfortable with exploring new data visualizations by yourself, and even

5
00:33.880 --> 00:39.520
designing and building your own you know had to search for what the D3 community is already put together

6
00:39.520 --> 00:44.470
with most visualizations and you should be comfortable with flicking through someone else's code to

7
00:44.470 --> 00:45.920
figure out what's going on.

8
00:47.700 --> 00:52.410
In this section I'll be running you through everything we've covered in this course and I'll leave you

9
00:52.410 --> 00:54.190
with a few final thoughts.
