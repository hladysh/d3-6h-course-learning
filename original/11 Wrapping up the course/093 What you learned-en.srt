In this lecture, I want to give you a quick summary of what you learned in this course.

1
00:12.970 --> 00:19.960
We covered a lot of content in D3, going all the way from complete novice level at the start, to a level

2
00:19.960 --> 00:23.330
where you're able to build incredible data visualization pages.

3
00:23.340 --> 00:24.190
at the end.

4
00:25.350 --> 00:30.120
In the first few sections of the course, I taught you about the simplest components of D3 that would

5
00:30.120 --> 00:36.820
keep coming up again and again as the material became more advanced. You learned about how SVGs and work

6
00:36.910 --> 00:44.680
how to append them to the screen with D3, and you had a basic primer in the D3 data join. In Section 4, 

7
00:44.690 --> 00:51.440
I introduced you to the fundamentals of visualization design. In section 5, we started adding updates

8
00:51.470 --> 00:53.200
onto our visualizations.

9
00:53.510 --> 01:01.350
And by the end of section 6, the user could directly interact with elements on the page. In Section 7, 8 and

10
01:01.350 --> 01:02.280
9,

11
01:02.340 --> 01:08.700
I gave you a quick run through of a whole host of different visualizations. On the way, we covered important

12
01:08.700 --> 01:17.270
topics like layouts, nests, and Queues, which you'll see everywhere going forward in D3. Finally, in the

13
01:17.270 --> 01:24.560
last section, I taught you the proper file structure to use to create a fully-fledged web app, where our visualizations

14
01:24.560 --> 01:30.190
could communicate with each other through events in a control file. We gradually added complexity with

15
01:30.190 --> 01:32.810
our projects as the course went on.

16
01:32.810 --> 01:39.070
We started off with just a few rectangles in the page which turned into a bar chart. We added in updates

17
01:39.080 --> 01:40.150
to make a clone of Gapminder's

18
01:40.160 --> 01:41.600
bubble chart.

19
01:42.050 --> 01:45.370
And then we added in events to make an interactive line chart.

20
01:46.240 --> 01:51.820
Finally the final project represented the culmination of everything that you learned in the course,

21
01:51.820 --> 01:56.740
as you created the professional data dashboard with many visualizations on the page at once.
