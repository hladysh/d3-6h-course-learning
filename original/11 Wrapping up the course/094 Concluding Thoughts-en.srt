1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,400
So that's it.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,490
This is as far as I can take you in the world of T-3.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,420
Like most things with programming courses like these can only take you so far.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,460
The way for you to take your skills to the next level is by practicing with more and more real world

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,410
projects.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,600
I don't know what your main motivation will have been when you first set out that journey of learning

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,450
to but there are endless possibilities the kinds of fascinating visualizations that you are now able

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,270
to create.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,540
There are lots of places out there where you can find open source data sets for a range of different

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,510
purposes.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,780
My favorite one is here at Kaggle dot com where users can upload data on just about anything.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,380
All of the data sets are rated according to how interesting they are and they cover a huge range of

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,690
different topics.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,940
I hope that by now you're used to the process of appropriating other people's code and figuring out

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,630
how to use these snippets in your projects.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,040
Don't be afraid to give back to this community as well by sharing the code that you write for others

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,420
to use.

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,800
You can contribute to the vibrant community that makes the three best visualization library out there.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,670
I hope that you enjoy taking this course.

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,640
It's been a pleasure to teach you.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
I've learned a lot by creating these lectures and it's been a fantastic experience for me to get to

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,390
share this knowledge with you.
